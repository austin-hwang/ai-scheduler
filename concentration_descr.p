V\u000aProfessor Ingrid Monson, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The Department of African and African American Studies brings together scholars and scholarship from many disciplines to explore the histories, societies, and cultures of African and African-descended people. The field of African and African American studies is not only interdisciplinary but also comparative and cross-cultural. Africans and people of African descent have developed cultural forms that have profoundly shaped the fine arts and popular culture in the Americas and all around the planet. Comparative and cross-cultural studies of Africa and its diaspora contribute enormously to our understanding of race and ethnicity, and ideas about race are among the central objects of study in the field of African and African American studies. In addressing the ethical, social, and political consequences of racial thinking, the African and African American studies faculty raise questions relevant to the experiences of all peoples.\u000a	The department offers two distinct courses of study: the African track and the African American track. African track concentrators come to the program with a variety of interests (e.g., the environment, public health, music, ethnic relations, religion, politics, economic development, and literature). Components of the African track include study in the African Languages Program, required courses, electives, and the option of study abroad. The department offers seminars and lecture courses on a variety of Africa-related topics. Concentrators in the African track are encouraged to take courses in a variety of departments, including history of art and architecture, music, economics, government, history, anthropology, social studies, Romance languages and literatures, and religion. Courses in the Divinity School, the Graduate School of Education, and Kennedy School of Government may also be available for concentration credit.\u000a	The African American track attracts students with an equally wide range of interests. There are many reasons students pursue African American Studies. First, African American music, literature, and visual arts are significant cultural achievements worthy of study in their own right. Second, African Americans have played a crucial role in the history of the United States, participating in the American Revolution, the Civil War, Reconstruction, women\u2019s suffrage, and the New Deal; and they led the struggle for equality in the second half of the twentieth century. Third, because American political life remains encumbered by racism and its historical legacy, a proper historical, sociological, and economic understanding of race relations continues to be essential for those who seek to make or evaluate public policy. Fourth, some of the social relations that have developed in countries such as the United States, Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, and Brazil provide important examples of ethno-racial conflict, and through the study of them it is possible to gain insight into what remains a problem across the globe.\u000a	Exploring African and African American cultures requires us to explore aspects of the many other cultures and peoples that have created the mosaic of the modern world. Thus, diaspora studies are integral to each track. In many parts of the Caribbean and Latin America, for example, religions and performance arts are influenced by traditional African belief systems and practices. The cultures of the African Atlantic diaspora have also developed in interaction with other peoples: the many Native American cultures; the Dutch, English, French, German, Irish, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Scandinavian, Scottish, Spanish, and other European groups that came with colonists and immigrants; and with the traditions that have come with immigrants from East and South Asia.\u000a	Students who graduate with a concentration in African and African American Studies go on to pursue advanced degrees in fields such as history, literature, political science, and sociology. They also go on to work in a wide variety of careers in education, business, medicine, entertainment, law, public policy, and the arts and sciences.\u000aREQUIREMENTSAfrican Studies TrackBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12-14 courses (48-56 credits)\u000aRequirements for Joint Concentration: 8 courses (32 credits), including thesis\u000aConcentration requirements for the Joint Concentration in History and African and African American Studies (African Studies track): 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aPlease also note the following information:\u000a	Two types of courses count automatically toward AAAS/History concentration requirements:\u000a	The joint concentration also regularly accepts credit from Study Abroad toward concentration requirements.

The department requires that students develop a focus as part of their declaration of the concentration. This plan of study will take cognizance of disciplinary requirements and the option of study abroad, yet it will be flexible enough to accommodate students in pursuit of their own specific intellectual interests. At the end of the sophomore year, students are asked to submit a 1-2 page Concentration Focus Statement describing the main area(s) of study they wish to explore. The Director of Undergraduate Studies will meet with students, if they request, in order to assist them in the formulation of the statement of concentration focus.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in African and African American Studies, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	The Franklin D. and Wendy F. Raines Library, in the Department of African and African American Studies, is located on the second floor of the Barker Center and contains a non-circulating collection of important books, academic and popular periodicals, and offprints, as well as an extensive audio and video collection. Past undergraduate theses are also available. An important resource for African Studies concentrators is the Committee on African Studies, which offers summer travel grants to assist Harvard juniors with senior honors thesis research. Please see their website for more information. They can also guide you to resources in teaching, research, and advisory work on Africa in a number of departments, centers, and institutes at Harvard. Harvard\u2019s Office of International Education has approved study abroad in eleven African countries. To plan their term in Africa students should meet with the Director of the Office of International Programs.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Students should consult the departmental website, which includes information about concentration rules, the senior thesis, model programs, faculty interests, and departmental resources.

aV\u000aDr. William J. Anderson, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB) is a life science concentration that educates students on how human beings develop from a fertilized egg, are maintained and repaired throughout adulthood, and age till life\u2019s end. Students will be given a broad education in modern life sciences by studying important biological principles within the specific rubric of the developing and regenerating body. By adding an explicit and heavy emphasis on hands-on research opportunities in all four undergraduate years, HDRB will engage students with an interest in research and take advantage of Harvard\u2019s special strengths as a teaching college and research university.\u000a	To the extent that \u201ctranslational\u201d or \u201capplied\u201d research focuses on the application of discoveries made in model systems to humans, the HDRB concentration will embrace the opposite approach. Its emphasis will be on rigorous basic science with a focus on what the study of humans reveals about fundamental biology and reciprocally, what a greater understanding of biology teaches us about ourselves. We believe that a fundamental understanding of how the human organism develops and maintains itself requires foundational knowledge in life sciences, chemistry, and physical sciences, which are in turn dependent on a fundamental knowledge of mathematics. The requirements for the concentration reflect this view.\u000a	Students begin their study via foundational courses in the life sciences. Ordinarily, students next will enroll in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (SCRB) 10, which is a gateway course for the HDRB concentration. SCRB 10 introduces concentrators to concepts presented in depth by later electives. Students will delve deeper into more focused topics through at least three upper level lecture or laboratory courses. SCRB 91r, which serves as the concentration tutorial, is ordinarily taken in the junior year. SCRB 91r is a semester-long course of independent laboratory research. Honors candidates must also enroll in SCRB 99 and submit a thesis.\u000a	The framework of the concentration takes advantage of faculty strength in both the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Harvard Medical School through the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. The curriculum provides a range of courses that will benefit students interested in medicine and biomedical research, as well as other fields in which a comprehensive understanding of human biology is needed.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 15 courses (60 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	The Director of Undergraduate Studies for HDRB, Dr. Bill Anderson, is available to concentrators and pre-concentrators to provide guidance on course selection, laboratory research, and the fulfillment of concentration requirements.

aV\u000aDr. Rowan K. Flad, Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS)\u000a	Anthropology brings global, comparative, and holistic views to the study of the human condition, exploring the enormous range of similarities and differences across time and space. It includes the study of how human behavior has evolved as well as how language, culture, and society have shaped and continue to shape the human experience.\u000a	The concentration in Anthropology aims to cultivate a critical understanding of this wide ranging experience.  To study the human condition is to confront the familiarity of the seemingly strange, and to interrogate the strangeness of that which seems familiar.  What does this mean? At the very least, it means stepping back and seeing ourselves the way others might see us \u2013 a shift in perspective that is foundational to human empathy and humility. Anthropology also invites deeper analysis of behaviors that we might think we fully understand but that have histories and complexities that only reveal themselves to careful investigation. This is why we do long term field research in local languages to understand social life in all its richness and depth. And finally, making the familiar strange demands an ethical and political accounting. It means not accepting the world as given. This might well be the heart of the discipline, its moral optimism: the conviction that things can be different and better -- and that knowledge about the world should be oriented towards greater empathy, solidarity, and equality. Through an insistence on the importance of context, anthropologists wrestle with the totality of intersections between human practices and behaviors, beliefs, culture, place, politics, identities, and more.  Some develop this awareness of cultural and social context into an engaged participation in the contemporary world through politics, work in the public sector, global health policy, journalism, cultural heritage work, the law, advertising or business.  For others the study of anthropology provides a foundation for graduate studies in anthropology or related fields.\u000a	At Harvard the Anthropology Department is divided into two programs: Archaeology and Social Anthropology.\u000a	Archaeology investigates the past human condition primarily through the identification, recovery, and analysis of the material remains of ancient peoples in the field and in the laboratory. Goals of archaeology include understanding such developments as the origins of modern humans, the beginnings and spread of agriculture, and the rise and elaboration of complex societies as well as the roles that archaeologically documented pasts play in the modern world.\u000a	Social Anthropology examines the social and cultural diversity of contemporary human experience, practice, and knowledge. Based on ethnographic field research, it provides a critical perspective on the understanding of everyday life in a globalized world, and the political, economic, and cultural interconnections within and among the societies of the world.\u000a	All students are strongly encouraged to take the opportunity to study and/or carry out research abroad, and gain a basic knowledge of both subfields (Archaeology and Social Anthropology). Beyond this, most students focus their studies within one of the two programs, meeting the concentration requirements set forward by the particular program concerned. Some students may choose to pursue a combined focus on both approaches, meeting reduced concentration requirements for both Social Anthropology and Archaeology.\u000a	The requirements for honors eligibility and tutorials are also distinguished by program. In Social Anthropology certain honors recommendations are possible without a thesis, but not to students pursuing a combined concentration in Archaeology and Social Anthropology. In Archaeology, honors recommendations require a thesis. Senior theses are generally supervised within a program, and the tutorials concentrate on problems of research within the subfields of each program. Anthropology concentrators may, however, take tutorials for credit in both programs if they so choose. Field and laboratory research are encouraged although not required.\u000a	While specialization in either Social Anthropology or Archaeology is the most common pattern of study, the Department also encourages interdisciplinary work across programs or between Anthropology and other disciplines. The Anthropology Department allows students to arrange joint concentrations with other FAS departments when appropriate and possible. Such concentrations are restricted to honors candidates and culminate in an interdisciplinary senior thesis. A joint concentration involves an individualized, coherent plan of study approved by both of the departments involved. The number of required Anthropology courses and basic program requirements may be reduced.\u000aREQUIREMENTSArchaeologyBasic Requirements: 10 courses (40 credits), including 2 tutorials\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12 courses (48 credits)THESIS TRACK (Honors, High Honors, and Highest Honors attainable)\u000aSocial AnthropologyBasic Requirements: 10 courses (40 credits), including 2 tutorials\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12 courses (48 credits)THESIS TRACK (Honors, High Honors, and Highest Honors attainable)\u000aNON-THESIS TRACK (Honors only)\u000a	All graduating seniors in Social Anthropology who are not thesis candidates may be considered for a non-thesis honors recommendation of Honors (but not High or Highest Honors), provided that their concentration grade point averages calculated at the end of their next to last semester are among the highest twenty-five percent of non-thesis candidates in their graduating class.\u000aCombining Archaeology and Social AnthropologyBasic Requirements: 10 courses (40 credits), including 2 tutorials\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aTHESIS TRACK (Honors, High Honors, and Highest Honors attainable)\u000a	Non-thesis honors are not available to students doing a combined concentration in Archaeology and Social Anthropology. These students may pursue honors via the thesis track only. Consult the DUS or ADUS.\u000aJoint Concentrations\u000a	The programs in Archaeology and Social Anthropology of the Department of Anthropology both encourage a joint concentration with any other department that permits a joint concentration. The Anthropology part of the joint concentration can serve as either the primary or allied field. Consult the DUS or ADUS and the concentration advisor in the allied field for details.\u000aArchaeology and another field outside of Anthropology\u000a	For the Archaeology portion of the joint concentration, there is a six course requirement.\u000aCourse Categories: The three archaeology courses must fulfill the following course categories. 1. Area: Old World archaeology course; 2. Area: New World archaeology course; 3. Topical/method/theory course;\u000aSocial Anthropology and another field outside of Anthropology\u000a	The Social Anthropology portion of the joint concentration consists of a six course requirement.\u000aConcentration requirements for the Joint Concentration in History and Anthropology (Archaeology or Social Anthropology track, or both): 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aPlease also note the following information:\u000a	Two types of courses count automatically toward Anthropology/History concentration requirements:\u000a	The joint concentration also regularly accepts credit from Study Abroad toward concentration requirements. With the exception of certain Freshman Seminars taught by History or Anthropology faculty (see above), courses taken on Pass/Fail basis may not be counted for concentration credit.\u000aADVISING\u000a	Advising in the Department of Anthropology is carried out by the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS), the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies (ADUS), faculty, senior graduate students, and the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. The DUS has overall responsibility for the academic progress of undergraduates and, along with the ADUS, is available by appointment for advice on academic and administrative matters. The Undergraduate Program Coordinator also provides information on departmental and College requirements and on administrative matters, particularly to Social Anthropology students. Starting in the junior year and depending on their interests, undergraduates often begin to work more closely with individual faculty members, senior graduate students (especially in Social Anthropology), and members of the staff of the Peabody Museum (especially in Archaeology) within the tutorial system. Choice of a faculty adviser depends largely upon the academic and research interests of the student.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Anthropology, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000aPeabody Museum of Archaeology and EthnologyFounded in 1866, the Peabody Museum is among the oldest archaeological and ethnographic museums in the world with one of the finest collections of human cultural history found anywhere.\u000aAlfred P.

There are Archaeologists in the departments of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Classics, and History of Art and Architecture, as well as a Standing Committee on Archaeology that includes individuals from across FAS who are practicing archaeologists or for whom use of the results of archaeological study are integral to their teaching and research. From time to time distinguished visiting scholars hold teaching appointments in the department. Harvard students have access to an exceptionally large number of professional anthropologists.\u000aFIELDWORK\u000a	Fieldwork may be taken for credit through an approved university. Although concentrators will register directly with the other university, they must first obtain permission from the Department of Anthropology at Harvard, and apply for credit through the Office of International Education.

Research in human evolutionary biology is increasingly influencing medical science, economics, linguistics, psychology, and political science, and HEB concentrators learn how to use an evolutionary perspective to help solve real world problems. Human evolutionary biologists use data at every level of biology, from genes to bodies to people in their ecological contexts, to answer questions such as:\u000a	Human Evolutionary Biology (HEB) provides a general foundation in human and organismic biology as part of the life sciences cluster of concentrations.\u000a	All HEB concentrators receive a core introduction to basic evolutionary biology as well as human and nonhuman primate genetics, physiology, anatomy, behavioral biology, and paleontology. HEB courses also explore interactions between genes and environments, and the co-evolution of biology and culture.\u000a	Students interested in human cognition or psychology, who want to understand the evolutionary influences on our thoughts and behaviors, may pursue the thesis honors Mind, Brain and Behavior track within HEB (\u201cMBB Track\u201d). Requirements are below.\u000a	We encourage our students to get involved in research in HEB, and we offer many small, advanced courses for students to work intensively with members of the faculty. Opportunities vary from primarily lab-based research\u2014such as in behavioral endocrinology, primate and human cognition, evolutionary genetics, physiology, anatomy, or nutrition\u2014to field-based work\u2014such as studying primates in East Africa or working on paleoanthropological excavations. Our faculty work closely with undergraduates on research projects of all kinds, for senior theses, research seminars and tutorial classes.\u000a	HEB offers a rigorous background in human evolutionary biology while encouraging interdisciplinary work.

aV\u000a Professor Elie Tamer, Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aProfessor Steven Gortler, Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aDr. Margo Levine, Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aDr. Sarah Iams, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Mathematical modeling is ubiquitous throughout the physical, biological, social, engineering, and management sciences. Mathematical scientists who identify themselves primarily as applied mathematicians develop, implement, and study mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques broadly applicable in various fields. In addition, they bring mathematical modeling skills to bear on particular scientific problems, using judicious approximations to obtain insights and predictions when the underlying phenomena are thought to be relatively simple and well understood, or creating conceptual frameworks for quantitative reasoning and measurement when the underlying phenomena are complicated and less well understood. In their methodological role, they may function temporarily as mathematicians, statisticians, or computer scientists; in their phenomenological role, they may function temporarily as physicists, chemists, biologists, economists, engineers, and the like. In both roles, they must possess relevant knowledge, technical mastery, and educated taste; clearly this necessitates specialization. Avowed practitioners of mathematically-oriented segments of other disciplines equally may function temporarily as applied mathematicians.\u000a	The range of activities carried on under the aegis of the principal professional organization in the field, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), can serve as an operational definition of the scope of the discipline. Various SIAM publications are readily accessible to Harvard students and student memberships are available. Ideally, over time, an applied mathematician demonstrates substantive involvement with both the mathematical and scientific aspects of their dual roles. In the long run, their contributions must be evaluated based on both methodological and phenomenological impact. Inside academia, their activities are usually carried out in collaboration with students or colleagues; outside academia, they often serve as part of a multidisciplinary team tackling complex problems under time and resource constraints. In either context, a premium is placed on having an outstanding ability to communicate with fellow technical professionals. Applied mathematics is inherently interdisciplinary, in motivation and in operation. This vision informs the design of the concentration.\u000a	The Applied Mathematics concentration consists of a broad undergraduate education in the mathematical sciences, especially in those subjects that have proved vital to an understanding of problems arising in other disciplines, and in some specific area where mathematical methods have been substantively applied. For concentrators, a core learning objective is building and demonstrating foundational knowledge in computation, probability, discrete, and continuous mathematics through the successful completion of the foundation and breadth courses.  In addition, through their coursework, concentrators should gain facility and comfort in using approximation to simplify problems and gain insight.  They should learn to communicate effectively with fellow technical professionals, and should be prepared, by their senior year, to tackle mathematical modeling problems in their area of application, at the level of a senior thesis.  Additionally, students can expect to be able to attain employment or, with appropriate planning, gain admission to graduate study in applied mathematics.\u000a	The concentration requirements are flexible, but structured and demanding. Individual programs should be arranged in consultation with an advisor, and are approved by the advisor and by the Co-Director, Associate Director, or Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies. The concentration is overseen by an interdepartmental Committee on Undergraduate Studies in Applied Mathematics, and administered by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).\u000a	Students select the concentration because they like mathematics, and especially the use of mathematics to solve real-world problems. Some want a deeper involvement with an area of application than may be provided within a mathematics, statistics, or computer science concentration. Others want a more mathematically-oriented approach to an area of application than that normally provided within the corresponding concentration; mathematical economics is a prime example. Yet others want a special program not otherwise available, usually involving an area of application in which mathematical modeling is less common. Applied mathematics programs will typically involve a broader range of study within the mathematical sciences and a narrower range of study within the area of application than alternate programs offered by neighboring concentrations. With a little forethought, it is ordinarily straightforward to change the chosen area of application or to transfer between this concentration and neighboring ones until the end of the sophomore year, and often beyond.\u000a	Some concentrators go on to graduate work or to employment in their area of application, or in applied mathematics. Others go on to professional schools in law, medicine, or business. Students interested in entering a PhD program should plan to take more technical electives than the minimum required for concentration, and should plan their program carefully with the Co-Director, Associate Director, or Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies.\u000aREQUIREMENTS14-15 courses (56-60 credits)\u000a	Prospective concentrators are encouraged to make early contact with concentration representatives. Students wishing to enter the concentration should review the concentration requirements, meet with the Assistant, Associate, or Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies to discuss their proposed program, and then submit a program of study at studyplan.seas.harvard.edu/. Students should be aware that interdisciplinary and interdepartmental programs will usually be more demanding than conventional programs in an established discipline. Prerequisite or corequisite courses not included in the program of study may be needed to provide background or perspective.\u000a	In addition to the courses listed specifically below, more advanced courses may be approved by petition in the context of a particular program of study. A petition must propound in writing a coherent and persuasive argument for the intellectual merit of the proposal in question. In certain areas of application, undergraduates routinely take courses designated as primarily for graduate students. Recommendations or restrictions on course selection may flow from the choice of a particular area of application.\u000a	Total course requirements may be reduced from fifteen to no less than twelve, and the balance of foundation and breadth courses are dependent on placement in Math courses as listed below in item 1a. Such placement is granted based on an appropriate Advanced Placement examination, the Harvard Mathematics Placement Test, or an equivalent college-level course taken elsewhere, provided this bypass is validated by successful completion (honor grades) of more advanced courses. Students seeking placement based on college-level work done elsewhere must submit a petition to the Co-Director, Associate Director, or Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies, supplemented by suitable supporting materials. Transfer students from other colleges will have their programs considered on a case-by-case basis in response to a petition documenting their previous preparation.\u000aADVISING\u000a	The Directors, Professor Elie Tamer, elietamer@fas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-1526; Professor Steven Gortler, sjg@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-3751; Dr. Margo Levine, mlevine@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-8129; and Dr. Sarah Iams, siams@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 495-5935\u2014serve as interim advisers to all students entering the concentration.

aV\u000aProfessor Gonzalo Giribet, Head Tutor\u000a	The concentration in Integrative Biology (IB) is designed to provide students with opportunities to explore topics across all of biology, and also to focus in detail on areas of particular interest.\u000a	IB asks questions about the function, evolution, and interaction of organisms, both now and in the past. What kinds of organisms are there and how are they related? How is an organism's functional design and behavior related to its environment? What are the genetic and morphological mechanisms underlying an organism's development, and how is evolution influenced by development? Integrative biology can be approached in many ways, reflecting an interest in a specific group of organisms (e.g., plants, animals, microorganisms), in level of organization (e.g., ecological systems, population genetics), in approach (e.g., systematics, biogeography, biomechanics, developmental biology, mathematical theory, neurobiology), or in sampling broadly across multiple areas. IB is, therefore, inherently an interdisciplinary field, ranging over different levels of biological organization, evolutionary processes, taxa, and physiological and molecular systems. Courses emphasize student learning, critical thinking, and may include participation in research and field experiences, with the goal of fostering a foundation of knowledge and appetite for life-long learning, as students prepare for careers in the life sciences and related fields and professions.\u000a	Students who are considering IB as a concentration are encouraged to complete the three introductory courses (Life Sciences 1a, 1b, OEB 10) by the end of their sophomore year. From the foundation of these introductory courses, students explore one or more areas in depth by taking upper-level courses. Students are encouraged to consult the life sciences undergraduate website for further details on various pathways through the concentration (i.e., suggested combinations of mid-level and upper-level courses) and lists of faculty who can provide advice in these areas. Students may also design their own pathway.\u000a	For many students, the concentration will culminate in independent research leading to a senior thesis, but a thesis is not the only means by which a student may participate in research. The concentration website provides information on research opportunities in IB as well as general advice about how to identify and contact faculty whose research is of interest. The concentration also provides opportunities to study biological diversity in the field, whether close to home or abroad. IB does not participate in joint concentrations but will consider senior theses that incorporate work from a secondary field.\u000aREQUIREMENTS13 courses (52 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000aQuestions should be addressed to the IB Concentration Adviser (Andrew Berry; 617-495-0684; berry@oeb.harvard.edu) or Director of Undergraduate Studies (Gonzalo Giribet; ggiribet@g.harvard.edu).

aV\u000aProfessor Edo Berger, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The concentration in Astrophysics builds the foundation from which students may consider some of the deepest questions of the physical universe. What was the state and composition of the Universe at the moment of the Big Bang? What is the nature of the force that currently dominates the expansion of the Universe? How do space and time behave in the vicinity of the black hole? How do galaxies form, and how do stars and planets form within those galaxies? Are there habitable worlds other than our own?\u000a	The science of astrophysics involves the study of matter and radiation in the universe as understood through the laws of physics. Astronomical phenomena exhibit an extreme range of physical conditions, from superfluid neutrons in neutron stars, high-temperature nuclear reactions in supernovae, and strong gravitational fields near black holes, to the unique state of the universe during its earliest phases. Theoretical attempts to describe these and more familiar phenomena (such as stars and galaxies) have achieved a useful understanding in many cases. However, our overall knowledge of the universe is still woefully incomplete, and our contemporary physical knowledge is often stretched to its limits in attempting to understand physical conditions that cannot be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories.\u000a	The concentration in Astrophysics introduces students to a broad range of phenomena through a program of both observational and theoretical courses. This program builds from a foundation of modern physics to a general account of the known contents of the universe. Astronomy 16 and 17 provide a complete introductory survey to the major fields of astrophysics. The research tutorial, Astronomy 98, places students in close contact with the wide range of research activities at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Undergraduates are strongly encouraged to pursue research projects (conducted under the mentorship of members of the faculty), which culminate in their junior papers and optional senior theses. Since the emphasis of astrophysics is on the explanation of phenomena in the universe in terms of physical theory, the initial stages of a concentration in Astrophysics closely resemble those of the Physics concentration, and the courses offered by the Department of Astronomy are readily accessible to any student with a good physics background. Our concentration offers avenues similar to Physics for future employment and research opportunities.\u000a	Astrophysics offers joint concentrations with other departments. In general, such concentrations involve meeting requirements for honors candidates in both fields. Joint concentrations combining Astrophysics with either Physics or with Earth and Planetary Sciences are particularly encouraged, although various other combinations are certainly possible. Students interested in joint concentrations are encouraged to contact the Director of Undergraduate studies, Professor Edo Berger, at 617-495-7914 or eberger@cfa.harvard.edu.\u000a	Students interested in completing a master\u2019s degree in astrophysics during their fourth year can find more detailed information in our section of the Advanced Standing at Harvard College booklet, and should contact the Astronomy department early in their degree program.\u000aREQUIREMENTS12 courses (48 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Upon joining the concentration, students are assigned a faculty adviser; students continue with the same adviser throughout their three years, unless there is a particular reason for making a change. Students meet with their adviser at least once per term and at other times as needed.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Astrophysics, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	The Department of Astronomy is located within the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which also contains the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Harvard College Observatory, at 60 Garden Street and 160 Concord Avenue, Cambridge. The Center for Astrophysics has a large staff of scientists and is among the largest institutions devoted to astronomy and astrophysics in the world. A very broad range of astrophysical research is conducted by the many scientists at the Center, in its divisions of Atomic and Molecular Physics; High-Energy Astrophysics; Optical and Infrared Astronomy; Radio and Geoastronomy; Theoretical Astrophysics; and Solar, Stellar, and Planetary Sciences. Scientists in these divisions encourage students to participate in their research. Full-time summer and part-time academic year employment is often available for Harvard undergraduates at the Center; please contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies for more information.\u000a	Through the Center for Astrophysics students may make use of a wide range of observational, experimental, and theoretical facilities. These include two 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes in Chile; the Multiple-Mirror Telescope and the 1.5-m and 1.2-m reflecting telescopes of the Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona; and the Submillimeter Array on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. In addition, students may participate in the analysis of data from a number of national and international observatories, including X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, ultraviolet and optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope, solar data from SOHO, radio data from the Very Large Array and the VLBI network, and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	The Director of Undergraduate Studies for the concentration is Professor Edo Berger.

aV\u000aProfessor Isabelle Charnavel, Head Tutor\u000a	Linguistics, the scientific study of language, is perhaps the ultimate interdisciplinary enterprise, cutting across the humanities, social sciences, cognitive sciences, physical sciences, and biological sciences. Since it is not taught in high school, most undergraduates, including many future Linguistics concentrators, only \u201cdiscover\u201d linguistics after they come to college. Some are intrigued by the prospect of discovering formal rules to model a complex form of behavior like language; others are interested in the relationship of natural languages to other symbolic systems; still others are curious about similarities and differences they have noticed among individual languages. In exploring these and similar topics, students of linguistics not only learn a great deal about a fascinating field; they also master a variety of conceptual and empirical techniques that stand them in good stead after graduation. Recent Harvard Linguistics concentrators have gone to graduate school in linguistics, mathematics, computer science, cognitive science, English, and music; to medical school, law school, and business school; and into employment in fields as diverse as editing, writing, translating, and language-processing software design.\u000a	The department understands that undergraduates are interested in linguistics for a variety of reasons. Some plan to pursue graduate studies in linguistics or a related discipline; some plan to go on to professional work; and some see a concentration in Linguistics as interesting and valuable intellectually, but do not base their future vocational plans upon it. The department has kept all of these considerations in mind in designing its course offerings and concentration requirements.\u000a	Many students who are curious about linguistics but who have never taken a linguistics course assume that it is chiefly a subject for people with an extensive background in foreign languages. This is incorrect. While it is true that some kinds of linguists need to have active control of a variety of languages, the overriding fact is that linguistics and language learning are completely separate pursuits. People who are \u201cgood at languages\u201d are not always good at linguistics, and vice versa; many of the world\u2019s most successful professional linguists are fluent only in their native language.\u000a	The courses offered by the Department of Linguistics reflect the diversity of the field. The emphases are on linguistic theory, historical linguistics, and the relationship between language and cognition.\u000aLinguistic theory\u000a	Every normal child learns a language between the ages of one and five. Linguistic theory seeks to characterize this knowledge explicitly and to account for the ease and speed with which humans acquire it. Since the bulk of the knowledge that enables us to speak and use language is unconscious, most people are unaware of its almost unbelievable complexity and richness. Nor is it obvious to the casual observer that the underlying structures of languages as superficially different as English, Zulu, and Navajo are deeply and fundamentally the same. The traditional branches of linguistic theory are syntax, the study of sentence structure; phonology, the study of the sounds and sound systems; morphology, the study of word structure; and semantics, the study of meaning.\u000aHistorical linguistics\u000a	All languages change over time, sometimes giving rise to one or more daughter languages and, eventually, to families of related languages. Depending on their specific interests, historical linguists may investigate the processes and principles by which language change occurs, or study the documented history of individual languages, or try to recover the prehistory of language families by using the \u201ccomparative method\u201d to reconstruct the unattested common parent of a set of attested daughter languages. A much-studied example of a reconstructed language is \u201cProto-Indo-European,\u201d the parent language of the family that includes most of the ancient and modern languages of Europe (including English) and northern India.\u000aThe Linguistics track in Mind, Brain, Behavior (MBB)\u000a	Since language is a distinctively human characteristic, the study of language provides an important take-off point for investigating the complexities of the human mind/brain. Linguistics spearheaded the \u201ccognitive revolution\u201d in the 1950s and has occupied a privileged position in debates on cognitive issues ever since. At Harvard, the Mind/Brain/Behavior (MBB) Initiative was founded to help faculty in distinct research areas collaborate on projects making use of emerging techniques in neuroscience. One such technique, brain imaging, has long been of interest to linguists; newer experimental work is establishing connections between linguistic theory and language processing, language acquisition, language use, spatial and social cognition, evolutionary psychology and biology, and neuroscience.\u000a	The Linguistics/MBB track gives students an opportunity to delve into the neurobiological, psychological, philosophical, and evolutionary aspects of language, in the process becoming familiar with the different ways that researchers in these fields approach language-related problems. Another option encourages exploration of the relationships between language and computer science, including computational neuroscience. Whatever their specific choices, students who elect to concentrate in Linguistics/MBB graduate with a unique knowledge base and an invaluable set of skills and tools.\u000a	The implications of the study of language are broad and interdisciplinary. Modern linguistics theory attempts to characterize a very complex domain of human knowledge, and is thus an area of central concern to philosophers of mind as well as to cognitive psychologists. Furthermore, since the models of language constructed by theoretical linguists are formal in character and inspired by computational and mathematical methodologies, linguistics has a mutually beneficial relationship with computer science and the study of artificial intelligence. Linguistics also offers a firm understanding of the nature of language to literary scholars and language teachers. Finally, since languages are cultural artifacts, the reconstruction of an extinct language can shed light on the physical surroundings and the social institutions of its speakers, making linguistics a topic of interest to anthropologists, sociologists, and archaeologists.\u000aConcentration requirements\u000a	Since high schools and even many universities do not offer courses in linguistics, the department\u2019s introductory courses presuppose no prior background in the field. Many linguistics concentrators, in fact, were unaware of the existence of linguistics as a subject before they took their first linguistics course at Harvard. Our courses therefore aim to introduce students to linguistic analysis and actively engage them in it. They also expose students to the great diversity found in the languages of the world. An extensive foreign language background is not required or assumed.\u000a	Concentrators in Linguistics can choose among three tracks: Linguistics; Linguistics with Related Field; and Linguistics with Mind, Brain, and Behavior. The three tracks have the same tutorial program and share a core set of required courses that emphasize argumentation and methodology in phonology, syntax, semantics, and historical linguistics. The Linguistics with MBB track has an additional set of three required core courses that emphasize argumentation and methodology in mind, brain, and behavioral science. Students who choose the straight Linguistics track meet the remainder of the non-tutorial course requirements by taking a combination of more advanced linguistics courses within the department and linguistics-related offerings in other departments. Examples of linguistics-related offerings in other departments include courses on the linguistic structure of particular languages (e.g., History of the German Language) and on the computational, philosophical, and psychological aspects of language (e.g., Psychology of Language). Students who choose the Linguistics with Related Field combine courses in linguistics proper with linguistics-related courses in an approved second field such as anthropology, classics, computer science, or psychology. Students who choose Linguistics with MBB meet the remainder of the non-tutorial course requirement by taking a combination of more advanced courses on linguistics or on mind, brain, and behavior. Examples of MBB-related courses typically include courses offered by the philosophy department (e.g., Philosophy of Language), by the psychology department (e.g., Cognitive Neuropsychology), and by the computer science department (e.g., Natural Language Processing).\u000a	Note that the Linguistics with Related Field and the Linguistics with MBB tracks are not the same as a joint concentration in Linguistics and another field. Joint concentrators have their study cards approved by both concentrations, and the other field may require additional courses beyond those needed for the Linguistics with Related Field or Linguistics with MBB tracks. Such students graduate with a concentration in Linguistics and the other field (e.g., Linguistics and Mathematics; Linguistics and Anthropology). Students in the Linguistics with Related Field or with MBB tracks, on the other hand, have their study plans approved only in Linguistics, and graduate with a concentration in Linguistics alone. Students in the Linguistics with MBB track receive a certificate from the MBB program as well. Additional information about the requirements for joint concentrators is provided below.\u000aOPTIONS\u000aREQUIREMENTSFor students entering the College in Fall 2011 or later. Other students should refer to the Handbook for Students from the year they declared their concentration.\u000aBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)Requirements for Honors Eligibility: 14 courses (56 credits)Linguistics Track\u000aLinguistics with Related Field Track\u000aLinguistics with Mind, Brain, and Behavior (MBB) Track14 courses (56 credits)\u000aJoint Concentrations\u000aNote: There is a crucial difference between the Linguistics with Related Field track or the Linguistics with MBB track and a joint concentration in Linguistics and another field. A student in Linguistics with Psychology as a related field or in Linguistics with MBB is solely under the jurisdiction of the linguistics department, while a student with a joint concentration in Linguistics and Psychology is under the jurisdiction of both linguistics and psychology\u2014that is,  the student needs to fulfill the requirements for joint concentration outlined by both fields. A student in Linguistics with Psychology as a related field graduates with a concentration in Linguistics; a student in Linguistics with MBB also graduates with a concentration in Linguistics and is awarded a certificate by the MBB program. A joint concentrator graduates with a concentration in Linguistics and Psychology.\u000a	Joint concentrations must be approved by both participating concentrations. Typically, joint concentrators take six courses in linguistics and six in the joint field and write a thesis that, to some degree, combines the two fields. Note that the same course cannot be counted as a required course for both fields simultaneously. Courses in the joint field should be selected in consultation with the Head Tutor of that field. Under normal circumstances, the following courses will be taken:\u000a	Joint concentrators ordinarily also enroll in two terms of senior tutorial in the primary field (the field listed first). Thesis advisers may be drawn from either of the two departments, subject to approval by the Head Tutors of both concentrations.\u000aADVISING\u000a	The Head Tutor and Assistant Head Tutor meet with concentrators individually at the beginning of each term to approve course selection and determine tutorial assignments. In addition, they are available to meet with students during regularly scheduled office hours or by appointment. Concentrators are also encouraged to contact other members of the faculty to discuss specific linguistics issues throughout the term.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Linguistics, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000aConcentrators are welcome to use the departmental lounge, library, and computing facilities located on the third floor of Boylston Hall. A phonetics lab where students can experiment with the acoustic and articulatory properties of the sounds of the world\u2019s languages is located in Boylston 334. Concentrators may also frequent the department\u2019s special collection of linguistic materials in Room B, on the top floor of Widener Library. Information about access to these locations can be obtained from the Department Administrator, Cheryl Murphy.\u000aSTUDY ABROAD\u000a	The Department of Linguistics encourages study abroad for concentrators. Students working on a specific language or language area may wish to spend a term or a summer abroad. They should discuss their options with the staff of the Office of International Education before meeting with the Head Tutor. Under appropriate circumstances, work done abroad may be counted toward the concentration requirement. Concentrators are encouraged to discuss their interests with the Head Tutor.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000aFor further information about the Linguistics concentration, please contact the Head Tutor, Professor Isabelle Charnavel (icharnavel@fas.harvard.edu), or the Department Office located on the third floor of Boylston Hall.

aV\u000aProfessor Daniel Needleman, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Biomedical Engineering lies at the intersection of the physical and life sciences, incorporating principles from physics and chemistry to understand the operation of living systems. As in other engineering fields, the approach is highly quantitative: mathematical analysis and modeling are used to capture the function of systems from subcellular to organism scales. An education in Biomedical Engineering, and engineering more broadly, enables students to translate abstract hypothesis and scientific knowledge into working systems (e.g., prosthetic devices, imaging systems, and biopharmaceuticals). This enables one to both test the understanding of basic principles and to further this knowledge, and it places this understanding in the broader context of societal needs.\u000a	In recognition of the pivotal importance of the life sciences and the technologies they inspire to our society, Harvard is committed to broadly educating engineers who will become leaders in the developing field of Biomedical Engineering. The objectives of this concentration include providing students a solid foundation in engineering, particularly as applied to the life sciences, within the setting of a liberal arts education. The concentration is flexibly structured for a diversity of educational and professional objectives. It enables the acquisition of a broad range of skills and attitudes drawn from the humanities, social sciences and sciences, in addition to engineering, which enhance engineering knowledge and which will contribute to future leadership and technical success.\u000a	The overarching intellectual goal of biomedical engineering is to apply quantitative engineering analysis to understand the operation of living systems and design novel systems to satisfy unmet needs in medicine and industry. Specific objectives for students undertaking the A.B. in Biomedical Engineering are:\u000a	The AB degree consists of 14 courses (56 credits). This degree prepares students for the practice of Biomedical Engineering and for graduate study in engineering and medicine, and it is an excellent preparation for careers in other professions (business, law, etc.) as it provides an ideal framework for a well-rounded technical and scientific education. The curriculum is highly structured, with advanced courses building on the knowledge acquired in math, science, and introductory engineering science courses. Concentrators are encouraged to complete the common prerequisite course sequence in their first two years at Harvard. This includes Math (21a and 21b, 23a and 23b, or Applied Mathematics 21a and 21b), Life Sciences and Chemistry (Life Sciences 1a and 1b), Physics (Applied Physics 50a and 50b; Physics 15a and 15b or 16 and 15b, or Physical Sciences 2 and 3 or 12a and 12b), and Engineering Sciences 53. Students are cautioned that it is more important to derive a solid understanding of these basic subjects than to complete them quickly without thorough knowledge; this material is extensively used in many subsequent courses. The Sophomore Forum provides an opportunity for students to become familiar with the range of engineering disciplines, research opportunities within the School, and to make industrial contacts in an informal setting.\u000a	The technologies that engineers create are changing at an amazing rate, but the fundamental tools of engineering that enable these advances remain more constant. The Biomedical Engineering curriculum emphasizes a solid background in the chemical and biological aspects of the Biomedical Engineering field, with ample opportunity to learn about state-of-the-art technologies. In particular, students will take courses in systems modeling (ES 53 and BE 110) to better understand and mathematically model non-linear, complex biological systems; thermodynamics (ES 181, ES 112, or MCB 199) to appreciate the basic driving forces underlying biological and chemical systems; the fundamental processes of heat and mass transport (ES 123) that often control the rates of system changes; and molecular to tissue level engineering of biological systems (BE 121, 125 or ES 221). Through this coursework students also gain experience in the engineering design process, the engineering activity that requires creative synthesis as well as analysis.\u000aREQUIREMENTS14 courses (56 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students interested in concentrating in Biomedical Engineering should discuss their plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Daniel Needleman, dneedle@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 384-6730; or the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Linsey Moyer, lmoyer@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-2840; or the Undergraduate Academic Programs Manager, Kathy Lovell klovell@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-1524.\u000a	Each undergraduate who elects to concentrate in Biomedical Engineering is assigned a faculty adviser. If students do not request a change in adviser, they have the same adviser until they graduate. Each student is reassigned to another faculty member while the student's original faculty adviser is on leave. It is expected that students will discuss their Plans of Study and progress with their Director or Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies at the beginning of each term. Students may also seek advice from their faculty adviser, the Director or Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies, or the Undergraduate Academic Programs Manager at any time.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Further information is available from the Undergraduate Academic Programs Manager in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Office of Academic Programs, Pierce Hall 110 (617-495-2833).\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December

aV\u000aProfessor Cliff Taubes, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Mathematics is the science of order, and mathematicians seek to identify instances of order and to formulate and understand concepts that enable us to perceive order in complicated situations.\u000a	Perhaps the most important concept of mathematics is that of function, which provides us with the means to study dependence and change. The study of real functions of a real variable (and later complex functions), particularly in connection with the limit concept, is called analysis. The most effective tool for this study is the infinitesimal calculus that analyzes the relation between functions and their derivatives. The study of number systems and their generalizations is called algebra. Here the primary concepts are group, ring, field, and module. The last great branch of mathematics is geometry, which now goes far beyond the classical study of the space we live in to include spaces of high dimension and topology, the abstract theory of shape.\u000a	Pure mathematics is concerned with these concepts and their interrelationships, while applied mathematics considers the relation of mathematical concepts to problems arising in other disciplines. Applied mathematics is not a single subject; rather it is almost as many different subjects as there are other disciplines. (But it would be a mistake to think that applied mathematics is organized in terms of the disciplines to which it is applied.)\u000a	The concentration in Mathematics is designed to acquaint the student with the most important general concepts underlying the three branches of modern mathematics. Concentration in mathematics will provide an adequate basis for further study in either pure or applied mathematics. Because so many disciplines now rely on the mathematical sciences, a concentration in mathematics provides a valuable background for many different careers. Concentrators who do not choose to continue in mathematics have often gone on to graduate work in other academic subjects or to professional training in law, business, or medicine.\u000a	Concentration in Mathematics requires a minimum of either twelve letter-graded courses or eleven letter-graded courses plus one freshman seminar, subject to the following conditions: Eight of the letter-graded courses must be listed as courses taught by the Mathematics Department while the remaining courses can be either mathematics courses or courses in approved, related subjects. These eight mathematics courses must include at least one course in analysis, one in algebra or group theory, and one in geometry or topology (all at the 100 level or higher). Tutorials (Math 99r) are encouraged, but not required. Ordinarily no more than one Math 99r course may count toward the concentration requirement. Reading courses, Math 91r, and Math 60r (the latter for senior thesis research only; SAT/UNS only), can be arranged, but do not ordinarily count toward concentration requirements. A Freshman Seminar can be used in lieu of one of the twelve letter-graded courses in mathematics or related fields if it is taught by a faculty member of the Mathematics Department and if permission to do so is obtained from the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Mathematics.\u000a	Each student is required to submit a five-page expository paper in mathematics. The paper should be an original, coherent, and correct exposition of a topic in pure or applied mathematics. The paper should be written during the sophomore or junior year under the supervision of a professor or tutor in a tutorial (Math 99r), a Math 91r reading course, or a 100- or 200-level course that the student is contemporaneously enrolled in. The paper must be accepted by both that professor or tutor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Ordinarily, students enrolled in a tutorial automatically satisfy the expository requirement as part of the structure of the tutorial. The expository requirement must be met before the end of the Reading Period of the second term of the junior year. Extensions may only be granted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\u000a	A candidate for high or highest honors must, in addition to the course requirements, submit a senior thesis.  The thesis may be on any topic in pure or applied mathematics not directly covered in a student\u2019s course work. It need not be an original piece of mathematical research, but should be an original exposition of material culled from several sources.  A candidate for straight honors (neither highest nor high) can either submit a senior thesis or take four extra courses in Mathematics or approved related fields in addition to the twelve course requirement described below under the heading Basic Requirements.  (See below under Requirements for Honors Eligibility for more details.)\u000a	In addition, the department offers a Mathematics and Teaching option designed for students who are enrolled in the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program (UTEP). Students who choose this option will acquire eligibility for the teaching certification required for public school teaching in many states.\u000a	The department encourages students to take the most advanced courses for which they are qualified. Nevertheless, students who enter as freshmen or Advanced Standing sophomores will not ordinarily be permitted to count courses taken elsewhere toward the twelve course requirement. Transfer students wishing to concentrate in Mathematics should consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies, who will review their transcripts and arrange their concentration requirements.\u000a	The department welcomes students who want to change their concentration to Mathematics as long as it is plausible that they can fulfill the requirements within the time remaining. Students considering Mathematics may also wish to consider Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, or Statistics. Joint concentrations with Computer Science, Philosophy, Physics, or other fields can be arranged.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12 courses (48 credits) plus thesis\u000aRequirements for Joint Concentrations\u000a	The requirements in Mathematics for a joint concentration differ according to whether Mathematics is the primary or allied field. If Mathematics is first, then the requirements are the same as the Requirements for Honors Eligibility as described above. If Mathematics is second, then the requirements are 5 courses in Mathematics, at least three of which must be at the 100 level and include at least one in each of the areas of analysis (numbered 110- 119), algebra (numbered 120-129), and geometry (numbered 130-139). For a joint concentration in which Mathematics is second, no expository paper is required.\u000aMathematics and Teaching Option\u000a	This option is offered by the Department of Mathematics to encourage students with a degree in mathematics to enter secondary school teaching. It is designed for undergraduates who are enrolled in the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program (UTEP). Students who complete UTEP will thereby obtain eligibility for the teaching certificate required for public school teaching by about thirty states, including Massachusetts. See Chapter 2 for more information on UTEP.\u000aNote: Those who plan to teach only in independent schools will not need a teaching certificate, and hence do not need to take this program. However, they too may wish to take UTEP courses to enhance their career preparation.\u000aRequirements for Mathematics and Teaching Option: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Concentrators are assigned a faculty member to act as their concentration adviser when their Plan of Study is approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Advisers assist concentrators in selecting courses and also sign study cards. In addition, each junior will be asked to meet privately at some point during the academic year with two faculty members to discuss academic progress and career goals.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Mathematics, please see the Advising Programs Office Website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	The department common room (fourth floor, Science Center) is open to all Mathematics.

aV\u000aProfessor Adam Cohen, Co-Head TutorProfessor Rachelle Gaudet, Co-Head Tutor\u000a	The Chemical and Physical Biology (CPB) concentration provides students with a broad foundation in the physical and life sciences. This concentration is designed for students interested in applying quantitative tools, physical concepts, and chemical principles to the study of biology.\u000a	Remarkable progress in the last four decades has revealed the atomic structure of proteins, enzymes, and genes; the nature of the genetic code; and how genes can be turned on or off in response to the demands of the environment. As our understanding of fundamental biological processes has increased, so has our appreciation that the focus on information transfer through nucleic acids provides an inadequate basis for understanding living systems. The activities of proteins are regulated by post-translational modifications\u2014chemical changes in protein structure\u2014and are affected by small signaling molecules. Dissecting metabolic pathways and reconstructing cellular networks requires supplementing the traditional arsenal of molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological techniques with advances in chemical and physical methods that make it possible to characterize the state of a biological system under a given set of conditions. Chemical and physical biology provides a link between classical approaches to studying biology and the chemical tools and physical methods required to understand dynamic changes in complex biological systems.\u000a	Students who are interested in understanding living systems in detail will require considerable proficiency in mathematics and physics as well as a broad background in both chemistry and biology. In its emphasis on quantitative, physical, and chemical tools, this concentration represents a significant departure from traditional undergraduate programs of study in the biological and life sciences. Our goal is to provide the next generation of life scientists with the background needed to make new advances in the quantitative understanding of living systems. The CPB concentration is intended primarily for students considering careers in research.\u000a	All students are required to participate in a tutorial unless engaged in thesis research. Tutorials for students in both Chemical and Physical Biology and Molecular and Cellular Biology are offered by the Board of Tutors in Biochemical Sciences, which was established in 1926. Tutors hold a PhD and/or an MD degree and meet with their students, singly or in small groups, about twice a month to discuss topics tailored largely to individual interests and needs. Tutorial sessions typically consist of readings selected from the primary literature or relevant texts. Mentoring on career choices, the research experience, and other academic issues is a logical extension of the tutorial. The tutorial is not taken for credit and therefore does not appear on the study card or transcript. A handout that describes the history, goals, and format of the tutorial program is available online.\u000a	All students are required to obtain a minimum of one term of laboratory research experience. This requirement may be fulfilled through a project lab course, a term of laboratory research (Chemical and Physical Biology 91), or research for a senior thesis (Chemical and Physical Biology 99A and B).\u000a	A thesis based on laboratory research is required to be eligible for honors in the Chemical and Physical Biology concentration. Students are encouraged to begin thesis research in a laboratory no later than the start of their junior year.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 16 courses (64 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 16 courses (64 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Professors Adam Cohen and Rachelle Gaudet and Dr. Dominic Mao are available to concentrators and pre-concentrators to provide guidance on course selection, laboratory research, and the fulfillment of concentration requirements.\u000aRESOURCES\u000aA tutorial reference library is housed in the CPB Undergraduate Office at 7 Divinity Avenue (95 Sherman Fairchild building), which contains books and hard copies of past senior theses (thesis titles from 2011-present can be viewed here).

aV\u000aProfessor Michael Aziz, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Mechanical engineering is a discipline of engineering that uses the principles of physics and materials science for the analysis and design of mechanical and thermal systems. Mechanical engineering is critical to the success of many human enterprises - it plays a central role in the generation and distribution of energy, transportation, manufacturing, and infrastructure development. Nearly every product or service in modern life has been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer.\u000a	The concentration in Mechanical Engineering is structured for a diversity of educational and professional objectives. For students who are planning to work as practicing engineers or who may be preparing for careers in business, education, government, or law\u2014and for those whose career objectives may be less specific\u2014the concentration provides an ideal framework for a well-rounded technical and scientific education.\u000a	The technologies that engineers create are changing at an amazing rate, but the fundamental tools of engineering change more slowly. The Harvard Mechanical Engineering curriculum emphasizes a solid background in the applied sciences and mathematical analysis and provides ample opportunity to learn about state-of-the-art technologies. Students also gain experience in the engineering design process, the unique engineering activity that requires creative synthesis as well as analysis to fulfill specified needs.\u000a	The objectives of the Mechanical Engineering program are to provide students a solid foundation in mechanical engineering within the setting of a liberal arts college for preparation for a diverse range of careers in industry and government or for advanced work in engineering, business, law, or medicine. It enables the acquisition of a broad range of skills and attitudes drawn from the humanities, social sciences, and sciences in addition to engineering, which enhances engineering knowledge and contributes to future leadership and technical success.\u000a	The SB degree program requires a minimum of twenty courses (80 credits). The curriculum is structured with advanced courses building on the knowledge acquired in math, science, and introductory engineering science courses. Concentrators are encouraged to complete the common prerequisite course sequence in their first two years at Harvard. This includes Math (through 1a and 1b; plus 21a and 21b, 23a and 23b, or Applied Mathematics 21a and 21b), Physics (through Physical Sciences 12a and 12b, Physics 15a and 15b, or Applied Physics 50a and 50b), and Computer Science 50. Students are cautioned that it is more important to derive a solid understanding of these basic subjects than to complete them quickly without thorough knowledge; this material is extensively used in many subsequent courses. If in doubt, it may be wise to enroll in the Math 1 sequence rather than proceed to Math 21a or 23a with marginal preparation.\u000a	The SB programs in Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Sciences share many course requirements, and there is some flexibility in moving between these programs. To get an early sample of engineering coursework, entering students are invited to enroll in Environmental Science and Engineering 6 (Environmental Science and Engineering), Engineering Sciences 50 (Electrical Engineering), Engineering Sciences 51 (Mechanical Engineering), and Engineering Sciences 53 (Biomedical Engineering). These introductory courses have minimal prerequisites and have been very popular with prospective engineering concentrators. Engineering Sciences 50 and 51 have extensive hands-on laboratory sections.\u000a	Upon graduation, students in the Mechanical Engineering concentration should demonstrate the following student outcomes:\u000aREQUIREMENTS20 courses (80 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000aStudents interested in concentrating in Mechanical Engineering should discuss their plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, or the Undergraduate Academic Programs Manager. Each undergraduate who elects to concentrate in Mechanical Engineering is assigned a faculty adviser depending on his or her area of specialization. The faculty adviser might also be a member of the Undergraduate Engineering Committee, whose members have the responsibility for reviewing departmental Plans of Study. If students do not request a change in adviser, they have the same adviser until they graduate. Each student is reassigned to another faculty member while his or her original faculty adviser is on leave. It is expected that students will discuss their Plans of Study and progress with their Director of Undergraduate Studies or Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies at the beginning of each term. Students may seek advice from their faculty adviser, the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, or the Academic Programs Manager at any time.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000aFurther information is available from the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Michael Aziz, maziz@harvard.edu, (617) 495-9884; the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Christopher Lombardo, lombardo@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-5185; or the Undergraduate Academic Programs Manager, Kathy Lovell, klovell@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-1524.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December\u000a	Mechanical Engineering was a new concentration for 2012-13.

aV\u000aDr. Gregg Tucci, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Chemistry is the science of the structure, properties, and reactions of matter. It is both a basic science, fundamental to an understanding of the world we live in, and a practical science with an enormous number and variety of important applications. Knowledge of chemistry is fundamental to an understanding of biology and biochemistry and of certain aspects of geology, astronomy, physics, and engineering.\u000a	The most important motivation for a concentration in Chemistry is an intrinsic interest in the subject. Career opportunities in chemistry include the areas of basic research, applied research and development, biotechnology, chemical analysis, manufacturing, and marketing. In addition, a degree in chemistry can be an excellent background for careers in many related fields, including law, medicine, business, environmental science, and other areas of science. Because of the diversity of interests of prospective Chemistry concentrators, the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology has designed a very flexible program of requirements which allows each student to select an area of emphasis. Courses in organic, physical, and inorganic chemistry as well as courses in chemical biology and biochemistry are offered. A few of these courses include required laboratory work, and special laboratory courses are available to advanced students in each area. In addition, concentrators may elect to pursue an individual research project with one of the research groups of the department. Each research group consists of advanced undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and a faculty member. In order to introduce students to chemical research and current topics of faculty interest, the department offers a non-credit sophomore tutorial in the spring term, a series of lectures by faculty members on their current research.  Concentrators can enroll in the junior tutorial, Chemistry 98r, in which the student joins a research group under the supervision of a faculty member. Often this work is continued throughout the senior year as Chemistry 99. Here the student becomes associated with current research in a particular area either by reading and studying recommended advanced material in that area or by undertaking an individual research project. Such projects often result in publications.\u000a	All of the courses in the department are open to properly prepared undergraduates and most upper-level courses do have some undergraduates. The more advanced courses are designed to be related closely to active areas of research in chemistry.  Current research activity is further stressed in the numerous seminars and colloquia in organic, physical, biophysical, and inorganic chemistry as well as in chemical biology, materials, energy and climate.  Some seminars are held jointly with other departments at Harvard as well as at MIT. Most research groups have meetings and informal seminars at which topics of interest are discussed.\u000a	In addition to a balanced program of at least eight courses (32 credits) in chemistry, concentrators are able to take courses in physics, biology, biochemistry, engineering, computer science, and mathematics as part of their concentration requirements. Because of the sequence of prerequisites for chemistry courses, the department strongly recommends some work in mathematics as well as chemistry in the first year. Freshmen contemplating this program are urged to consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies of the Chemistry concentration in planning their work for the first year.\u000a	Students graduating with a degree in chemistry will gain skills in a range of areas from reading scientific papers to conducting experiments safety and ethically to learning how to identify and propose solutions to problems that are novel and important. Because research is a foundation for the study of chemistry we believe that all students in the concentration should participate in an authentic research experience by the end of their senior year.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 12-14 courses (48-56 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14-16 courses (56-64 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	The Director of Undergraduate Studies initially serves as faculty adviser for new concentrators until they join research groups, usually through the Chemistry 98r tutorial, or otherwise establish a working relationship with another faculty member who agrees to serve as faculty adviser. Either the Director of Undergraduate Studies or another faculty adviser may sign study cards or advise on concentration matters. Students interested in concentrating in chemistry should discuss their plans of study with the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Chemistry, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Further information is available at the office of the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Chemistry, Dr. Gregg Tucci, Science Center 114 (617-496-4668), tucci@fas.harvard.edu.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December

aV\u000aProfessor Vlad Denic, Head Tutor\u000a	The Molecular and Cellular Biology concentration emphasizes the intersection of modern research in cellular biology with medicine and society. It is rooted in the investigation of biological processes based on the study of molecules and their interactions in the context of cells and tissues, and in understanding how the vast information context of the genome orchestrates the behavior of the cell. MCB is therefore ideally suited for students who wish to study molecular and cellular processes at the heart of both normal physiology and disease. It focuses on fundamental principles of modern biology at the hub of nearly all life science sub-disciplines, and integrates many different methodologies ranging from chemistry and genetics to computer science and engineering, as well as fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics.\u000a	MCB concentrators will acquire an understanding of scientific logic and approaches as they explore a wide range of contemporary subjects, spanning biochemistry, cell biology, genomics, systems biology, developmental biology, immunology, cancer biology, molecular medicine, the microbiome, global health and infectious disease. Students will also have the opportunity to tackle subjects of a more applied nature, such as drug design, personalized medicine and biotechnology.\u000a	Through coursework and hands-on research, students in the concentration will have the opportunity to explore many of the central questions in modern biology and medicine. The MCB faculty is dedicated to supporting undergraduate research, and we encourage students to join the laboratory of an MCB faculty member or a laboratory in one of the affiliated Centers, at Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, and affiliated institutes. We consider the senior thesis to be the capstone academic experience, and the concentration will provide extensive support to seniors to make thesis writing an enriching experience.\u000a	MCB graduates will be informed citizens who can understand and evaluate the impact of new research discoveries in the life sciences, discoveries that are unfolding at a breathtaking and accelerating pace. Both courses and programs that promote interactions with faculty members link basic, mechanistic insights with human disease and show how the study of disease leads to fundamental biological discoveries. Graduates of the MCB concentration will stand poised to pursue a wide range of careers, including biological and medical research, public and global health, science policy, law and intellectual property, business, education, and science writing.\u000a	The Board of Tutors in Biochemical Sciences, which was established in 1926, runs the Tutorial program for the Molecular and Cellular Biology concentration and the Chemical and Physical Biology concentration. The tutorial program offers individualized instruction to all concentrators beginning at the time of declaration. Concentrators typically meet with their tutors every two weeks and discuss primary research literature in a small group or one-on-one setting. Mentoring on career choices, the research experience, and other academic matters is a logical extension of the tutorial. The tutorial is not taken for credit and therefore does not appear on the study card or transcript.

aV\u000aProfessor Howard Georgi, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Physics and Chemistry are intellectual neighbors, sharing a large and somewhat arbitrary boundary. Scientists in this exciting boundary area study many of the same systems.  They use many of the same experimental and theoretical tools. The concentration in Chemistry and Physics is supervised by a committee comprised of members of the Departments of Physics and of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, and is administered through the office of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. As the name suggests, the concentration has been established to serve students wishing to explore this boundary who need to develop a strong foundation in both physics and chemistry. Because of the need to cover a wide range of material in considerable depth, only an honors-eligible program is available in this concentration.\u000a	The requirements of the Chemistry and Physics concentration are designed to provide a solid foundation for further study in either or both of these two closely related sciences. Concentrators have gone on to graduate work and careers in chemistry, physics, and other quantitative fields. The concentration is also often chosen by students whose career goals lie in medicine. In addition, the intellectual disciplines involved provide a suitable background for careers in many different professions.\u000a	Because the requirements of the concentration lie between those of Chemistry and of Physics, it is possible that a given set of courses could satisfy the requirements of one of those concentrations as well as those of the concentration in Chemistry and Physics. By the same token, a transfer to or from one of these concentrations, even as late as the junior year, normally causes little difficulty.\u000a	The concentration is structured to assure that all concentrators are introduced to the core subjects of chemistry (organic, inorganic, and physical); of physics (mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum theory); and of mathematics. Beyond this core, students take additional courses in chemistry, physics, or related sciences, according to their personal interests and objectives.\u000a	Tutorial or individual study and research are optional, and may be undertaken within the framework of Physics 90r and/or 91r, or of Chemistry 98r and 99r.\u000aREQUIREMENTS13-16 courses (52-64 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students interested in concentrating in Chemistry and Physics should discuss their Plans of Study with the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies. When Plans of Study are approved, each undergraduate who elects to concentrate in the field is assigned a faculty adviser from either the Physics or Chemistry department. If students do not request a change in adviser, they have the same adviser until they graduate. It is expected that students will discuss their programs and review their progress with faculty advisers at the beginning of each term. Students are told to seek advice at any time and can see their advisers at regularly scheduled office hours or by making an appointment. Students may also seek advice from the Director or Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies or Chair of the Chemistry and Physics Committee at any time.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Chemistry and Physics, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	The resources and facilities available to this concentration are essentially those of the Chemistry and Physics departments combined.

aV\u000aEmily Dolan, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aThe concentration in Music exposes students to a wide variety of musical styles, sounds, and musical traditions in order to develop their critical understanding of music in diverse cultural and historical contexts. The concentration also provides a solid foundation in theory, analysis, composition, and criticism, while developing critical listening skills, which are a pivotal contribution that engagement with music makes to the humanities. Although the Department of Music is not in itself a school of music with a performance department, all of our courses support the intellectual development of musicians, and several of our courses incorporate or focus on performance.\u000aStudents are encouraged to participate (with credit) in faculty-led ensembles in orchestra, chorus, jazz, and dance. We offer a wide range of introductory and advanced courses in music theory, composition, historical musicology, ethnomusicology, in addition to many courses that incorporate or focus on musical performance. These courses reflect the specialties of our academic faculty: eighteenth-century material culture, diaspora studies and migration, opera, jazz, music and politics, early music, musical theater, music and media, country music, improvisation, hip hop, musics from around the world, history of the book, film, American and European modernism, music and cognition, music and ecology, new music of the 21st-century, and cross-cultural composition.\u000aStudents choose their own pathways through these course offerings, creating a mix of introductory and advanced courses that best reflect their musical interests and aspirations. Students may enter the concentration from any music course, including performance courses, Freshman Seminars, Gen. Ed. and introductory courses, as well as through the first year theory course. The heart of the concentration is the two-semester concentration tutorial, \u201cCritical Listening\u201d and \u201cThinking About Music.\u201d These required courses, taught by different faculty on a rotating basis, provide listening and analytical skills as well as a familiarity with a wide range of methodologies in music studies.\u000aStudents continue with electives that invite engagement with musical questions at a deeper level. In musicology and ethnomusicology, these courses take the form of proseminars for small groups that explore in detail selected musicological issues and direct students toward significant independent projects. Several courses in acoustic and electronic composition are given each year, along with occasional offerings in orchestration and other specific compositional topics. Advanced theory and analysis courses include such topics as tonal and post-tonal analysis, jazz harmony, and modal and tonal counterpoint. Performance-oriented courses include chamber music, jazz, South Indian, West African, historical performance practice, improvisation, conducting and creative music.\u000aThere are three concentration tutorials: 97T Thinking about Music, 97L Critical Listening, and 98 Advanced Tutorial. The two concentration tutorials, Music 97T and Music 97L, can be imagined as offering a macrocosm and microcosm of the musical world. Where Music 97T tackles broad questions pertaining to music and its place in human existence, Music 97L focuses the lens on a more detailed level of engagement with music. Music 98 (optional for joint concentrators), emphasizes skills that students may be able to use with the view to a senior thesis or \u201ccapstone project.\u201d\u000aFor those writing senior theses, a year of Senior Tutorial (Music 99r) is required. Options for senior theses include research papers, original compositions, or senior recitals. There are no general examinations for undergraduates.\u000aThe department welcomes joint concentrations with other departments that allow them. Students who had wished to pursue a joint concentration with a department that does not allow them should consult with the DUS to explore how best to pursue their course interests in music. Joint concentrators need to fulfill a reduced number of course requirements, as outlined below. A senior thesis is required on a topic in which both fields are represented.\u000aFor students who feel they require more time for applied practice and study, the department offers a five-year performance program. Students approved by the department and the Administrative Board for this program take the normal number of courses in their freshman year, but then work at the three-course rate for the four years following. This permits more intensive work in performance. These students are expected to give a senior recital.\u000aStudents who have taken college courses in music at other institutions may receive concentration credit for work done elsewhere. This ordinarily involves a written petition to the faculty and may require taking an examination in the materials of the course for which credit is requested.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 10 courses (40 credits)\u000aDepartment of Music Course offerings are categorized as follows:\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aJoint Concentration Requirements: 8 courses (32 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000aAll students are required to confer with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies at the outset of their concentration or joint concentration, in order to develop an overall plan for fulfillment of requirements.

aV\u000aProfessor David Elmer, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Classics as an intellectual discipline embraces the study of ancient Greece and Rome, two civilizations whose legacy has played a major role in shaping our modern world. The Greeks and Romans produced literature and philosophy of enduring power and impact; they created art and architecture of unsurpassed grace and beauty; they made discoveries in science and math that anticipate principles and theorems re-discovered in the Renaissance; they grappled with problems of economics and governance that still challenge us today. In short, the Greco-Roman world provides the modern student with a laboratory of the human condition. Hence, the Department of the Classics encourages its students to explore the whole range of Greco-Roman civilization from the Bronze Age through Byzantium and medieval Europe to Modern Greece.\u000a	To study Classics at Harvard, no prior knowledge of an ancient language is required. Students may either start Greek and/or Latin from scratch, or build upon prior knowledge by taking more advanced courses. Two concentration options are offered within the department: Classical Languages and Literatures, for students wishing to emphasize the study of Greek and Latin literature in the original languages; and Classical Civilizations, for those primarily interested in exploring Greco-Roman culture through an archaeological, historical, or philosophical lens. Classics is essentially inter-disciplinary, combining the study of language, linguistics, and literature; archaeology, art, and architecture; history; philosophy, science, and medicine; and myth and religion. Hence, in addition to its dedicated Joint Concentration in Ancient History (Greek and Roman), which is offered in conjunction with History, the department welcomes joint concentrators combining Classics with a large number of allied fields.\u000a	As well as requirements in Greek and/or Latin, all concentrators take at least one of the department\u2019s foundational courses in Greek culture &amp; civilization and Roman culture &amp; civilization (Classical Studies 97a and 97b); in the junior year they choose one of a suite of small-group tutorials in advanced research methods (Classics 98); and in their senior year, all Classics concentrators have the option of writing a thesis under faculty supervision (Classics 99, mandatory for joint concentrators). Beyond these requirements, students have a wide range of courses to choose from, including courses in translation. Furthermore, courses from related departments are regularly cross-listed with Classics, so that students can craft the concentration to accommodate their individual interests.\u000a	Classics concentrators have at their disposal the resources of the Herbert Weir Smyth Classical Library, and they are encouraged to conduct primary research on ancient artefacts, coins, manuscripts, and papyri in the unparalleled collections of Houghton Library and the Harvard Art Museums. During the summer, students are given the chance to complement their experience in the classroom by undertaking an internship at one of Harvard\u2019s classical institutes in Washington DC (the Center for Hellenic Studies and Dumbarton Oaks); participating in an archaeological dig; learning to speak Latin in Rome or Greek in Athens; taking summer courses in Italy or Greece; or traveling to Europe (or elsewhere) to learn one of the modern languages that are fundamental for classical scholarship\u2014typically French, German, or Italian.\u000a	By mastering Greek and/or Latin and acquiring the skills necessary to analyze and interpret the remains of Greek and Roman culture, students learn to make sense of material that is both dauntingly complex and disconcertingly fragmentary. The effort of trying to understand the thoughts and actions of people who are separated from us by a gulf of two millennia teaches our students to test their assumptions in every human situation. The challenge of finding out about an aspect of Greco-Roman civilization for which no substantial evidence appears to survive develops resourcefulness and flexibility\u2014research skills that can be transferred to any walk of life. Concentrators in Classics learn to think rigorously and to express themselves precisely in both speech and writing.

aV\u000aProfessor Gojko Barjamovic, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations introduces students to the ancient and modern peoples, languages, cultures, and societies of the Near and Middle East. Loosely defined as stretching from Morocco in the west to Iran and Afghanistan in the east, the region is home of the world\u2019s great religions and civilizations. Historically, the influence of its languages, literatures, and cultures has extended well beyond these regions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and North America. Thus, the study of the Near and Middle East is an important area of academic inquiry on account of its political, economic, and cultural significance globally.\u000a	The concentration offers students a multi-faceted and inter-disciplinary perspective on Near and Middle Eastern cultures and languages that have been so influential throughout the world. Undergraduate concentrators develop skills in one (or more) of the languages and literatures of the region on their way to choosing from a wide variety of directions of study. The Department offers instruction in a range of ancient and modern languages including Akkadian, Arabic, Aramaic, Armenian, Babylonian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Iranian, Persian, Sumerian, Turkish (Ottoman and Modern), and Yiddish.\u000a	One of the strengths of the concentration in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations is the individual attention each student receives in pursuing the student's interests within the broader arena of the Near and Middle Eastern Studies. Students choose one of four specific tracks for concentration: The Middle East in Antiquity, Histories and Cultures of Muslim Societies (Islamic Studies), Jewish Studies, or Modern Middle Eastern Studies. The Director of Undergraduate Studies assists each student to make an informed choice among these options, and assigns a faculty member to serve as the student's mentor/adviser, advising on courses and other work as the student progresses. The department also offers secondary fields in the four areas listed above as well as language citations in several Middle Eastern languages.\u000a	The four concentration tracks may be described as follows:\u000aThe Middle East in Antiquity focuses on the rich and diverse history of the civilizations of the ancient Near/Middle East, which witnessed the first complex societies and the first major developments in social and political organization, literacy, technology, religious institutions, and many other areas. The legacies of these ancient cultures, represented by Egyptology, Assyriology, Levantine, Syro-Palestinian, and several other fields, remain a critical force in subsequent Middle Eastern\u2014and world\u2014history today. The goal of this track is to give students a rewarding acquaintance with the history and culture of the principal civilizations of the ancient Near East, and to reveal how such history and culture is reconstructed through the critical analysis and synthesis of linguistic, textual, artistic, and archaeological evidence.\u000aHistories and Cultures of Muslim Societies (Islamic Studies). The goal of this track is to provide a basic exposure to fundamental elements of the histories, literatures, philosophy, religious thought, and legal institutions of Muslim societies. As the study of Islam and Muslim societies at Harvard is an interdisciplinary endeavor, the program in Histories and Cultures of Muslim Societies (Islamic Studies) is structured to allow students flexibility in their approach to the field; this is done by incorporating one of the disciplinary perspectives currently available in the Harvard curriculum: Study of Religion, Anthropology, History, History of Art and Architecture, Gender Studies, Comparative Literature and Languages, and Law. Since Islam in the Near East has historic and contemporary connections to Muslim societies around the world, this track encourages a global and transnational perspective. In this regard, our program offers faculty expertise not only in the Middle East, but also sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia.\u000aJewish Studies. This track explores many facets of Jewish religion, law, literature, philosophy, and culture; and the history of the Jews in the Middle East and the diaspora. Through basic courses, it offers undergraduates the framework of knowledge for pursuing further comparative study, and teaches Jewish languages (Hebrew and Yiddish) at several levels for students who wish to pursue independent studies in one or more areas of Jewish civilization. Students in this track have pursued joint programs with many other departments and concentrations, including History, Comparative Literature, Classics, Music, English, Slavic, and Ethnic and Gender Studies.\u000aModern Middle Eastern Studies. In this track students study the cultures, history and politics of modern Middle Eastern societies. Such study involves a combination of courses in a variety of fields drawn especially from the humanities and interpretive social sciences. The requirements are designed with sufficient flexibility so that students may pursue the field as an introduction to the region as a whole, or as a more narrowly-focused exploration of a particular country or theme, depending on their interests.\u000a	It should be noted that concentration in all four tracks may include courses not only from the NELC department, but from other departments and programs in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, as well as from other Harvard faculties, like the Divinity School, the Law School, and the Kennedy School of Government. In choosing such courses, each student will have the guidance and the approval of the faculty mentor/adviser and of the NELC Director of Undergraduate Education. Students are encouraged to begin their exploration of the concentration track that interests them through designated gateway courses. In addition, all tracks have a requirement that involves the study of at least four terms of a language of the region. This is based on our conviction that facility with the appropriate language(s) is the starting point of all serious work in the study of the Near and Middle East. To further this goal, as well as to provide prolonged exposure to the civilizations of the region, the department makes possible, in conjunction with the Office of International Studies, various study abroad programs, from a summer, through one semester, to an entire year. Such programs generally take place during the student's junior year, and will receive concentration credit providing the course work falls within the concentration track and is approved by the student's mentor/adviser and the Director of Undergraduate Studies along with the Office of International Education.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aJoint Concentration:\u000a	Possibilities for joint concentrations exist and are welcome in NELC. The Department has a joint concentration with the Department of History whose requirements are indicated below. For joint concentration with other Departments, the student must make a case for it to both NELC and the other department or program concerned. Joint concentrators take four terms of a language, the sophomore and one junior tutorials, and at least one other course in Near/Middle Eastern studies, in addition to a senior tutorial in two terms focused on the writing of a senior thesis that combines the two fields. As for undergraduate students with advanced standing, they have the option for applying for a joint A.B./A.M. degree. More details about these and other aspects of the NELC concentration are available in the NELC Undergraduate Concentrator's Handbook.\u000aConcentration requirements for the Joint Concentration in Near Eastern History: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aPlease also note the following information:\u000a	Two types of courses count automatically toward NELC/History concentration requirements:\u000a	The joint concentration also regularly accepts credit from both Study Abroad and Advanced Standing toward concentration requirements. With the exception of certain Freshman Seminars taught by History or NELC faculty (see above), courses taken on Pass/Fail basis may not be counted for concentration credit.\u000aJoint concentration with other Departments: 9 courses\u000aADVISING\u000a	Sophomores and other new concentrators meet first with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, with whom they discuss their interests and arrange to meet with a member of the faculty who will serve as mentor/adviser in the concentration. Junior and senior concentrators meet with their mentors on a regular basis.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	Harvard\u2019s library resources in the various fields of Near and Middle Eastern Studies are virtually unparalleled. Widener Library, for example, has vast holdings in Arabic, Armenian, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, and Yiddish literature. The Andover-Harvard Library of the Harvard Divinity School also has excellent resources available to students.\u000a	Students wishing to specialize in modern Near Eastern political or social studies should familiarize themselves with the resources and personnel of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Those interested in Jewish studies should become familiar with the resources and personnel of the Center for Jewish Studies. The Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Islamic Studies Program coordinates the study of Islam and Muslim societies across the University and has useful resources on its website, including a comprehensive listing of all Islam-related courses being offered in all of Harvard's departments and schools.\u000a	The Harvard Semitic Museum, in which the department is housed, has a superb collection of ancient and medieval artifacts representing many of the cultures of the Near East. As a University teaching museum, the Semitic Museum is dedicated to providing access to these materials for study and teaching.\u000a	For concentrators interested in Biblical or other ancient Near Eastern studies, or in the archaeology of the Near East, a variety of opportunities for archaeological work in the Middle East are available. These include the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon, which is conducted by the Harvard Semitic Museum under the directorship of Professor Lawrence E. Stager of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	First-year students interested in a concentration in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations should arrange to meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Gojko Barjamovic (barjamovic@fas.harvard.edu). Students are also encouraged to obtain a copy of our brochure online, as well as our undergraduate handbook \u2014The Concentration in Near Eastern Studies at Harvard\u2014online, by mail, or in person from the department office at 6 Divinity Avenue, 617-495-5757.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December

aV\u000aDr. Sandra Naddaff, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aThe undergraduate program in Comparative Literature prepares students to play an active and creative role in today\u2019s globalized world by exploring literature and culture across languages and national borders.  Working in more than one language, our students investigate the inter-connections among literatures, cultures, and media to explore the human experience in a comparative and interdisciplinary context.\u000aThe flexible nature of the concentration allows students to develop a program of study both within and beyond the Humanities based on their particular languages and interests. Some students craft a curriculum in Literature and the Arts, linking the study of literature with film, music, theater, digital media, or creative writing. Others design a program that connects literary study to contemporary concerns and disciplines beyond the Humanities, focusing their work on the relationship between Literature and Medicine, or Literature and Law, or Literature and Ethics, for example. Still other students find in the study of Comparative Literature a place for the comparative study of multiple literatures, World Literature, and translation, or the examination of aesthetics, philosophy, and literary and cultural theory. Our concentrators work across many languages\u2014Hindi, French, Spanish, English, Chinese, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Arabic, Swahili\u2014to name but a few.  We welcome work in any foreign language in which a student has an interest.  In cases where a student does not have the necessary linguistic competence to undertake literary study, we are happy to help make arrangements towards fluency.\u000aIn consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the student\u2019s academic advisor, undergraduate concentrators develop an individually tailored and carefully structured program of study that brings together their particular interests and languages and allows them to take courses in a variety of departments across the Humanities. Central to each student\u2019s curriculum is the tutorial program. The one-semester sophomore tutorial seminar introduces students to various disciplinary methodologies and forms of literary and cultural analysis. Junior tutorial offers students the rare opportunity to design their own reading course in which they work one on one with a tutor and ultimately develop a special field of study. Senior tutorial is again an individual course of study largely devoted to the research and writing of the senior thesis, which is required of all students. All tutorials are reading and writing intensive, and form the core around which a student develops a larger field of study. For more information about students\u2019 special fields and senior thesis projects, please see the \u201cUndergraduate Concentration\u201d link on our website, www.complit.fas.harvard.edu.\u000a	Students with degrees in Comparative Literature develop habits of mind that serve them well in any number of professional endeavors. The ability to write well, to read critically, to argue analytically, and to speak eloquently, translates fluently to a variety of fields. Our graduates include doctors, lawyers, literary scholars, cultural critics, investment bankers, actors, novelists, consultants, and journalists among many others. For a fuller list of our alumni, please consult the \u201cLit alumni\u201d link on our web site, www.complit.fas.harvard.edu.\u000a	In order to help students determine whether they can meet their academic and intellectual goals in our department, we ask interested students to apply to the concentration during the fall of the sophomore year, although later applications will also be considered whenever possible. Application includes submitting a brief statement of interest and essay, as well as a conversation with two members of the department.\u000aREQUIREMENTS14 courses (56 credits)\u000aJOINT CONCENTRATION\u000a	It is possible to pursue a joint concentration with Comparative Literature as either a primary or allied field. Please make an appointment with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to discuss specific requirements.\u000aADVISING\u000a	Each Comparative Literature concentrator is assigned a tutor who also functions as the student\u2019s adviser. In the sophomore year, this tutor is assigned by the Director of Undergraduate Studies, but in following years a student may either request a tutor from among the faculty members of the Department of Comparative Literature and the Tutorial Board; or the student will be assigned a tutor (generally a member of the Tutorial Board) by the Director of Undergraduate Studies according to the student's interests. Generally, this tutor changes from year to year as the student\u2019s program and interests change. In certain cases, however, a student may request the same tutor for more than one year.\u000a	The department offers a variety of courses that might be of interest to freshmen and first-semester sophomores, but it has no specific course that is a pre-requisite. Students who are interested in the program might wish to take any of the 100-level courses listed in Comparative Literature in the course search in courses.my.harvard.edu. Students interested in Comparative Literature might also wish to take a language course in their language of choice, if they wish to improve their foreign language competency.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Comparative Literature, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Freshmen interested in finding out more about Comparative Literature should contact Dr. Sandra Naddaff by email (snaddaff@fas.harvard.edu) or should make an appointment to see her during office hours by calling 617-495-4186.\u000a	For general information contact Dr. Sandra Naddaff, Director of Undergraduate Studies; or Ms. Isaure Mignotte, Comparative Literature Program Coordinator, at Dana Palmer House, 617-495-4186.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December

aV\u000aProfessor Jeff Lichtman, Head Tutor\u000aNeuroscience, the study of the nervous system, is a field that investigates the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior as well as how brains process information. To develop a comprehensive understanding, we study the nervous system at every level: from the macroscopic (behavior and cognition) to the microscopic (cells and molecules). Consequently, the questions that neuroscientists ask are wide-ranging. For example, how do electrical, chemical, and molecular signals allow neurons to process and transmit information from the environment? What guides the development of the immense number of precise connections in the nervous system? How can the complex signals of many thousands of active neurons be recorded, interpreted, and modeled? What causes the profound behavioral deficits in Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Autism Spectrum Disorders?\u000a	To answer these kinds of questions, neuroscientists study a variety of model systems including cultured cells, fruit flies, zebrafish, mice, monkeys, and even humans. Simpler systems allow experimental manipulations (e.g., gene knockouts/knockins, protein over/mis-expression, drug treatments, activity silencing) and invasive recording techniques (e.g., fluorescently labeling cells and proteins, electrically/optically recording neurons and networks, electron microscopy of the synapses and circuits). Studies in humans often focus on characterizing patterns of brain activity during development or disease using non-invasive recording techniques (e.g., fMRI and EEG). Neuroscientists may also use approaches from computer science and mathematics to analyze signals that arise from the brain or to understand the computational properties of neural networks. Thus, the study of neuroscience provides both a broad scientific training and a deep understanding of the biology of the nervous system. Given the diversity of interests in this field, the only prerequisite for students entering this concentration is an intense curiosity about the brain.\u000a	The Neuroscience curriculum includes a series of fundamental courses in the life and applied sciences. A central course on the neurobiology of behavior, Neuro 80 (formerly MCB 80), lays out the body of knowledge in neuroscience. In advanced elective courses, students explore specific areas of neuroscience more deeply based on their interests. We now list over 40 advanced courses on a range of topics: cells and circuits, physiology, learning and memory, cognitive science, development, genetics, computational modeling, and disease and therapeutics. In addition to the course offerings, neuroscience is one of the most vibrant fields of research at Harvard, and students will have many opportunities for hands-on laboratory experience and independent research projects to complement and deepen their studies.\u000a	We offer three tracks within the Neuroscience concentration. The first, the \u2018Neurobiology Track\u2019, provides the greatest focus on biology and neurobiology coursework and ensures a solid foundation in the life and physical sciences. For this track, Honors is optional. The second track, the \u2018Mind, Brain, and Behavior Track\u2019, allows students to look beyond the biology of the brain and see how other disciplines (e.g., anthropology, economics, computer science, history of science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology) approach the study of the mind. This is an Honors track and requires an undergraduate thesis. The third track, the \u2018Computational Neuroscience Track\u2019, allows students to develop skills in mathematics and computer science to analyze and model the signals of the brain. For this track, Honors is optional.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements:\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14-16 courses (56-64 credits)\u000aRequirements for Joint Concentrations\u000a	Students interested in a joint concentration should consult the advisors in both concentrations at an early date.\u000aADVISING\u000a	Dr. Ryan Draft and Dr. Laura Magnotti, the Neuroscience Concentration Advisers, are available to provide guidance to concentrators and pre-concentrators on course selection, laboratory research, and fulfilling concentration requirements.

aV\u000aProfessor Stephen Chong, Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aProfessor Boaz Barak, Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Computer science is a dynamic, versatile field, full of open problems and opportunities for creative invention.  Computer science is not just about tools and technology. Whether it is swarms of insects, elementary particles, rational agents in a market, or the neurons in the brain, the computational viewpoint has proven an extremely fruitful way to understand natural, social, and engineered systems. Correspondingly, the Computer Science concentration has strong ties not just to engineering, but also economics, law, biology, physics, statistics, mathematics, and more.\u000a	The concentration in Computer Science is designed to teach students skills they will use immediately and ideas they will exploit in the future in ways unimaginable today. Because information technology affects every aspect of society, graduates with computer science degrees have open to them an enormous variety of careers\u2014engineering, teaching, medicine, law, basic science, entertainment, management, and countless others.\u000a	The Computer Science concentration has the following learning objectives. Our graduates should be able to:\u000a	In addition to these technical objectives, we identified five softer objectives. We hope our graduates will be able to:\u000aREQUIREMENTS\u000a	There are four types of concentrations in Computer Science: Basic Concentration, Honors Concentration, Joint Concentration, and the Mind, Brain, Behavior track of the Computer Science concentration.\u000a	The number of credits required for each degree depends on the student\u2019s mathematics placement. The ranges given here depend on whether the student starts mathematics at the Mathematics 1a, Mathematics 1b, or Mathematics 21a level. (With good planning it is also possible to earn a Computer Science degree starting with Mathematics Ma.) For example, a basic concentration requires 48 credits (12 courses), of which Mathematics 1a and/or Mathematics 1b can be waived, depending on placement, to reduce the number to 44 or 40 credits (11 or 10 courses).\u000a	In all of the requirements below, a student may replace a course with another course covering the same material at a more advanced level. For example, Mathematics 21b can be replaced with Mathematics 25a. For information on which courses are considered acceptable replacement, see our website or ask the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\u000a	No student may reduce concentration requirements by omitting any other course other than Mathematics 1a or Mathematics 1b: any other required course not taken must be replaced by a similar course at a more advanced level.\u000a	The four concentration options share the following common requirement structure.\u000aBasic Requirements: 10-12 courses (40-48 credits)\u000a					3: Economics and Computation (any course of the form CS13x or CS23x)4: Hardware and Networks (any course of the form CS14x or of the form CS24x. Physics 123 and Engineering Sciences 153 count in this group as well).5: Programming Languages (CS51 if counted as a technical elective, or any other course of the form CS15x or CS25x).6: Systems (CS61 if counted as a technical elective, or any other course of the form CS16x or CS26x)7: Graphics, Visualization, and User Interfaces (any course of the form CS17x or CS27x).8: Artificial Intelligence (any course of the form CS18x or CS28x).\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12-14 courses (48-56 credits)\u000aRequirements for Joint Concentrations: 36-44 credits for CS field (9-11 courses for CS field)\u000a	Joint concentrations with certain other fields are possible. This option is intended for students who have interests in the intersection of two fields, not simply in the two fields independently; for example, a combined concentration in computer science and linguistics might be appropriate for a student with a special interest in computational linguistics. Course requirements are the same as for the Requirements for Honors Eligibility, except that only three technical electives are required. These three technical electives must satisfy the breadth requirement as stated in Breadth Requirement, with the further provision that one semester of Computer Science 91r may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement for joint concentrations. Such courses may also be double-counted towards the requirements of the other field. Joint concentrations are not \u201cdouble majors.\u201d Joint concentrators should be interested in the overlap between two fields, not simply in both. A thesis in the intersection of the fields is required for joint concentrators, read by both concentrations. The student is typically awarded the minimum honors recommended by the two concentrations separately. These requirements, including the thesis requirement, are the same whether Computer Science is the primary field or the allied field of the joint concentration. Students interested in combined programs should consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies at an early date and should work carefully with both concentrations to ensure all deadlines and requirements of both concentrations are met. Students with separate interests in more than one field should consider a secondary rather than a joint concentration, or simply using some of their electives to study one of the fields. We advise all our joint concentrators to make sure that they satisfy the non-joint requirements for at least one concentration, in case they are unable to complete a thesis.\u000aThe Mind, Brain, and Behavior Program\u000a	Students interested in addressing questions of neuroscience and cognition from the perspective of computer science may pursue a special program of study affiliated with the University-wide Mind, Brain, and Behavior Initiative, that allows them to participate in a variety of related activities. (Similar programs are available through the Anthropology, History and Science, Human Evolutionary Biology, Linguistics, Neurobiology, Philosophy, and Psychology concentrations.) Requirements for this honors-only program are based on those of the computer science Requirements for Honors Eligibility, except that:\u000a	Students pursuing the Mind, Brain, and Behavior track are assigned an adviser in the field and are expected to participate in the University-wide Mind, Brain, and Behavior research milieu, including a non-credit senior year seminar for Mind, Brain, and Behavior thesis writers. To participate in the MBB track, students must both complete the Computer Science concentration Plan of Study and register at the beginning of every academic year on the MBB website. Interested students should contact the Computer Science liaison to the MBB program, Professor Stuart Shieber (shieber@seas.harvard.edu).\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students interested in concentrating in Computer Science are urged to consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies early and often for advice on placement in courses and selection among courses. The Director of Undergraduate Studies is happy to talk with freshmen and sophomores about their Plans of Study and to answer questions. When a student enters the concentration mid-way through the sophomore year, the Director of Undergraduate Studies assigns a professor to serve as the student\u2019s faculty adviser. Every effort is made to match the student\u2019s special interests to the expertise of the adviser. Students should consult their advisers regularly, certainly at the beginning of each term. When a faculty adviser is on leave, the student is temporarily reassigned to a new adviser. Students desiring a change of adviser for any reason should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies. The Director of Undergraduate Studies is also available to discuss problems or questions of any kind with students in the concentration.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Students interested in computer science are invited to join the mailing list for the Computer Science Newsletter, which carries announcements of new courses, colloquia, job and internship opportunities, and a variety of get-togethers for the Harvard computer science community. Information about the newsletter and other community resources can be found on the Computer Science website.\u000a	For further information, students should consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies, (cs-dus@seas.harvard.edu).\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December

aV\u000aProfessor Bernhard Nickel, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aDr. Cheryl Chen, Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Philosophy studies many of humanity\u2019s fundamental questions. Some of these questions arise when we reflect on the most basic and most widely shared elements of human experience:\u000a	Whether in the street, court, classroom, or lab, we often assume implicit answers to these questions. Some of those answers, and even the questions themselves, are the product of a centuries-old philosophical tradition that has shaped and reshaped our society and culture. Philosophy seeks to reflect on these questions and answers in a systematic, explicit, and rigorous way\u2014by studying the tradition, relying on careful argumentation, and drawing from outside fields as diverse as economics, literature, religion, law, mathematics, the physical sciences, and psychology. Those fields raise philosophical questions of their own:\u000a	Philosophical questions are everywhere. If you find yourself drawn to them, studying philosophy in college is likely the best opportunity in your life to address them.\u000a	Whether they take just a course or two or end up concentrating, students find studying philosophy to be among the most rewarding intellectual experiences of their college careers. The department offers a rich array of classes to choose from, and students develop their own responses to the philosophical problems that attract them in conjunction with their study of philosophical writing. The department\u2019s introductory courses help students to develop their reading, writing, and reasoning skills while acquainting them with broad surveys of major areas and historical periods.

aV\u000aProfessor Jerry Mitrovica, Co-Head Tutor  Professor TBD, Co-Head Tutor\u000a	Harvard offers outstanding opportunities for students who wish to pursue studies in Earth and planetary sciences. Research and course work in the Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) department encompass a broad range of science disciplines, technology, and applications to environmental and economic endeavors. These studies involve students in the development and application of new tools and technologies, state-of-the-art computational modeling of a wide range of Earth planetary processes, and field work in remote and challenging settings.\u000a	These are intellectually exciting times for the Earth and planetary sciences, which are of unprecedented importance to contemporary society. Our environment is increasingly subject to stresses placed upon it. As never before, we have an imperative to better understand the consequences of human activities for the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the oceans, the solid Earth, and the organisms that live on it. Exploring for, extracting, and conserving natural resources are vital to the global political economy. We must mitigate the ill effects of earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, and climate change by learning to predict their time and place. Moreover, new technologies, datasets and computational capacity are allowing us to better understand the functioning of Earth systems and the interplay between tectonics, climate, and life.\u000a	Because the Earth\u2019s natural systems (atmosphere, ocean, biosphere, solid earth) are interconnected, the training of Earth and planetary scientists broadly spans the boundaries between biology, chemistry, engineering, physics, mathematics, and the Earth sciences themselves, and provides a broad intellectual foundation that is beyond what is typically possible in a "pure" science program. The department trains students rigorously in the basic sciences, typically in the same foundational courses as students in Astrophysics, Chemistry, Engineering Sciences, and Physics. These foundational courses are followed by upper-level courses that focus on disciplines within Earth and planetary sciences. Within the EPS department students may focus on atmospheric and ocean science, energy and climate, environmental geoscience, geobiology, geochemistry, geology, planetary sciences, and solid earth geophysics.\u000aTo facilitate and reinforce our interdisciplinary vision, students are required to take at least one course in each of the three major sub-disciplines in the department: Atmosphere(s) and Oceans; Earth History and Geobiology; and Geology, Geophysics and Planetary Science. Moreover, all students are encouraged to participate in department-sponsored field experiences. Many students complete their studies with a senior thesis that affords the opportunity to do original research under the guidance of department faculty.\u000a	Career opportunities in Earth and planetary sciences are diverse, spanning the private, government, and academic sectors. Government service includes research and administration in NASA, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency, the US Geological Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, and many other agencies and departments. Earth scientists work in and direct a number of oil and mineral exploration and production companies. Many opportunities continue to grow for entrepreneurs who build companies specializing in resources, natural hazards, waste repositories and cleanup, and environmental impacts. There also are abundant opportunities in the academic world for those continuing on to graduate degrees; and in addition to scientific career paths, an undergraduate degree in Earth and planetary sciences provides an excellent background for continuing study in law, business, and medicine.\u000a	The research environment of the department is an unparalleled resource for undergraduate education. Concentrators may work with faculty and graduate students on major research projects as a research or field assistant, in the context of course work, or as part of an undergraduate research project. Class sizes are small and student-professor contact is frequent and informal. Each graduating senior becomes personally acquainted with numerous faculty members in the department. Writing a senior thesis, which may be based on field, laboratory, or theoretical research, provides students with the opportunity to explore beyond the elementary level in one or more of the subspecialties of Earth and planetary sciences.\u000aREQUIREMENTSRequirements: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000a	1.

aV\u000aProfessor Howard Georgi, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The concentration in Physics, administered by the Department of Physics, serves a variety of goals and interests. Many concentrators seek an understanding of the subtle, profound, and fundamental laws\u2014relativity, quantum mechanics, and the basic force laws\u2014that govern the behavior of all matter. Often these studies involve the smallest units of matter: molecules, atoms, nuclei, and sub-nuclear particles. A major interest of other Physics concentrators is the exploration and explanation of the diverse properties to which these laws give rise in macroscopic systems such as fluids and solids. Still others study aspects of more complex systems like oceans and atmospheres, stars, and living matter.\u000a	A concentration in Physics provides a foundation for subsequent professional work in physics, and also for work in computer science, astronomy, biophysics, chemical physics, engineering and applied physics, earth and planetary sciences, geology, astrophysics, and the history and philosophy of science. Less obviously perhaps, the intellectual attitudes in physics -- blending imagination, prediction, observation, and deduction -- provide an excellent base for subsequent graduate work in professional schools of medicine, education, law, business, and public administration.\u000a	It should be emphasized that since all the physical sciences require basic training in physics and mathematics, an early choice of concentration need not be a final one. It is quite possible to design a program that will permit a change in concentration at the end of the sophomore year or even later. For example, a student who has satisfied most of the requirements for a concentration in astronomy probably has also satisfied most of the physics requirements as well, and vice versa.\u000a	The department tries to provide the essential content of undergraduate physics in concentrated form, leaving students sufficient time to develop interests through related courses offered by other science departments, to pursue more advanced and specialized aspects of physics through graduate-level courses and independent study or laboratory work, or to take advantage of the opportunities Harvard provides for a broad liberal arts education. Keeping the number of required courses small (twelve courses in physics and related fields; 13 courses for honors candidates) allows individual students to construct programs suited to their interests and career plans.\u000a	There are two basic avenues for entering Physics or one of the other concentrations in which it plays a major role. Most students commence their studies with the Physics 15a, 15b, 15c sequence of courses. This avenue is recommended for those who have had a normal high school course in physics or no previous physics at all. Students who enter with the appropriate Advanced Placement background may begin their study of physics with Physics 16 instead of Physics 15a. The Physics 15a, 15b, 15c courses are taught both terms, so that those students who wish to begin Physics in the second term may do so. Students may also begin with Physical Sciences 12a/b or Applied Physics 50a/b; see item 1.A in the Basic Requirements below.\u000a	The Physics department does not require that undergraduates take tutorials, i.e., individual instruction. This is not because independent study is considered unimportant, but rather because it has been deemed more important to keep the concentration requirements flexible enough to satisfy the differing goals of a great variety of students. There are programs that enable students to examine special fields and topics in some detail under the guidance of experts. We offer the following optional tutorial and independent study programs: (1) Physics 91r: individual study of material not covered in regular courses, supervised by a member of the department; (2) Physics 90r: individual research under the supervision of a faculty member interested in the field. The exact form of the project depends on the student\u2019s experience and interest, the nature of the particular field, and the availability of necessary facilities and funds. Concentrators desiring to write a senior thesis may do so under this program.\u000a	Physics does offer joint concentrations with other programs (e.g., Physics and Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and Physics and History and Science) with the provision that the student\u2019s Plan of Study be approved by the Director or Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students must complete the Honors Physics track if Physics is the primary (first) field in the joint concentration; the Basic Physics track suffices if Physics is the allied (second) field. Within the Physics department we provide an applied physics option, which emphasizes courses covering physical applications (see Requirements for the Applied Physics Option). We also offer a biophysics option, which allows a limited substitution of biology courses for physics-related courses (see Requirements for Biophysics Option). Finally, we offer a physics and teaching option, which provides both preparation in physics and eligibility for the teaching certificate required for public school teaching in many states (see Requirements for the Physics and Teaching Option). See also the concentration in Chemistry and Physics. We also collaborate in offering many of the courses required for concentrations in Astrophysics and in applied sciences.\u000a	No thesis or general examination is required for a degree with honors in Physics.\u000aOPTIONS\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aRequirements for the Applied Physics Option: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aRequirements for the Biophysics Option: 13 courses\u000aRequirements for the Physics and Teaching Option\u000a	This option is offered by the Department of Physics to encourage well-prepared students with a degree in Physics to enter secondary school teaching in the much-needed areas of physics, physics and chemistry, physics and general science, and physics and mathematics. Students who choose this option will complete the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program (UTEP) as part of this program. They will thereby obtain eligibility for the teaching certificate required for public school teaching by about thirty states, including Massachusetts.\u000aNote: Those who plan to teach only in independent schools will not need a teaching certificate, and hence do not need to take this program. However, they too may wish to take UTEP courses to enhance their career preparation. (Basic Physics concentrators who plan on teaching in public schools after graduation should inquire at the Graduate School of Education about the possibility of admission to UTEP, independent of this option.)\u000a	Under this option, there is a variety of choices depending upon the intended subject area of secondary school teaching. But note that in each case Advanced Placement credit is acceptable in lieu of the corresponding required course work.\u000aPhysics with Teacher Certification in Physics\u000aPhysics with Teacher Certification in both Physics and Chemistry\u000a	The requirements are the same as for Teacher Certification in Physics, except that:\u000aPhysics with Teacher Certification in Physics and General Sciences\u000a	The requirements are the same as for Teacher Certification in Physics, with the addition of:\u000a	Two courses in biology, normally Life Sciences 1a and 1b; but the minimum number of subject area courses to be taken will still be 13.\u000aPhysics with Teacher Certification in Physics and Mathematics\u000a	The requirements are the same as for Teacher Certification in Physics, except that:\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students interested in concentrating in Physics should discuss their Plans of Study with the Director or Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies. When these are approved by the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, each undergraduate who elects to concentrate in Physics is assigned an additional faculty adviser. Students keep the same adviser until they graduate unless they request a change. It is expected that students will discuss their programs and review their progress with faculty advisers at the beginning of each term. Students are encouraged to seek advice at any time and can see their advisers at regularly scheduled office hours or by making an appointment. Students may also seek advice from the Director or Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies at any time.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Physics, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	The Science Center houses many modern facilities for undergraduate instruction in physics. For example, concentrators will find most of the books and journals needed for their undergraduate courses in the Godfrey Lowell Cabot Science Library which is located there. (More advanced references are available in the Physics Research Library in the Jefferson Laboratory.) In addition, the computers used in undergraduate physics courses are located in the Science Center as are the instructional laboratories, one in practical laboratory electronics, and an advanced physics laboratory.\u000a	Students desiring to extend their research experience beyond the experiments available through the teaching laboratories may obtain access through the Physics 90r program to facilities for ongoing research in atomic and molecular physics in the Lyman Laboratory, solid-state physics in the Gordon McKay Laboratory and the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering, high energy physics in the High Energy Physics Laboratory, astrophysics through the Center for Astrophysics, and in biophysics through the various Biological Laboratories.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	For further information about the Physics concentration, the Physics department, and related departments with a major physics component, the best single reference is the pamphlet The SPS Guide to Physics and Related Fields.

aV\u000aProfessor Ryuichi Abe, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The concentration in East Asian Studies seeks to develop a critical understanding of the human experience in East Asia. To study East Asia is to be exposed to a world with different forms of political activity and social relations, religious traditions of great depth and philosophical schools with enduring insights, and literatures of unusual range and power. It is also to study a world that since the 19th century has come to share in the dilemmas of modernity that we all confront. For some this inquiry provides a challenging and satisfying addition to a liberal arts education. For some it is an opportunity to restore connections to an ancestral past. For others it leads to graduate studies. And for many others it is the beginning of a professional career with an East Asian component. The program provides preparation for a variety of fields of work and advanced study after graduation. Study abroad is encouraged.\u000a	A concentrator develops skills in a language, participates in the tutorial program, and selects from a rich offering of lecture courses and seminars. The program allows students to learn about East Asia as a whole and also to pursue specialized study of one or more East Asian societies: China, Japan, Korea, or Vietnam. While there are some commonalities among the many cultures and peoples of East Asia, there are also innumerable differences that mark each of these cultures and peoples as distinct in their own right. Thus a primary goal of the Concentration in East Asian Studies is to expose students to both the unity and the multiplicity of this vast and complex region.\u000a	The concentration offers a broad range of possibilities for students interested in the social sciences or the humanities. EAS facilitates course work in social sciences, incorporating approaches to modern East Asia drawn from political science, sociology, anthropology, economics, and psychology. Students with an interest in the humanities can choose to study modern and pre-modern East Asia from the perspectives of history, literature, art history, cultural studies, religion, philosophy, and folklore. EAS faculty are drawn from the departments of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, Anthropology, Economics, Government, History, History of Art and Architecture, Sociology; the schools of Business and Law; and the Kennedy School of Government. The sophomore tutorial introduces a variety of perspectives from the humanities and the social sciences, and offers concentrators a forum to interact with Harvard\u2019s East Asia faculty. At the end of the sophomore year, students typically decide on a disciplinary or area focus or choose a comparative perspective (involving one or more than one area or discipline) in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and their assigned faculty advisor. Juniors take an EAS 98 offering or an approved course to serve as their junior tutorial, and may choose to spend the summer in East Asia doing research or internships. Honors candidates usually spend the senior year researching and writing the honors thesis.\u000a	The East Asian Studies concentration welcomes joint concentrators. Primary concentrators in another field who are interested in language study take six courses of language, the sophomore tutorial, and two area courses. Those interested in area studies take the sophomore tutorial and five additional courses on East Asia. Please consult the East Asian Studies tutorial office for detailed requirements.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aConcentration requirements for the Joint Concentration in East Asian History: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000a	Students whose interest in East Asian civilization is primarily historical should consider concentrating in East Asian History. East Asian History is a joint concentration co-sponsored by the History Department and the East Asian Studies concentration. It aims to take advantage of the strengths of both concentrations. The goal of the program is to introduce students to the craft of historical study\u2014the ways historians make sense of the past, and the skills of historical analysis, writing, and research\u2014as well as to promote a critical understanding of the historical experience of East Asian societies. In addition to in-depth language study and substantial course work in the history of East Asia, students enrolling in this concentration will do one half of their tutorial work in the History Department and the other half in the East Asian Studies concentration. The sophomore tutorial in History introduces students to the analysis of historical writing in various genres, while the EAS sophomore tutorial introduces the history, literature and intellectual traditions of China, Japan, and Korea. By taking a History department research seminar or an EALC research seminar, students are introduced to methods of historical research and writing and have the opportunity to conduct in-depth research projects. In the senior year, joint concentrators will work with an appropriate faculty adviser and graduate student tutor to write a thesis, an original work in some aspect of East Asian history.\u000aPlease also note the following information:\u000a	Two types of courses count automatically toward East Asian History concentration requirements:\u000a	The joint concentration also regularly accepts credit from both Study Abroad and Advanced Standing toward concentration requirements. With the exception of certain Freshman Seminars taught by History or East Asian Studies faculty (see above), courses taken on Pass/Fail basis may not be counted for concentration credit.\u000aADVISING\u000a	All concentrators meet individually with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies during the first week of each term. At other times, students are welcome to drop in during office hours as often as is desired or necessary. At the end of the sophomore year, students consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies regarding their choice of disciplinary and area focus. Students are also encouraged to make appointments to meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies, and faculty adviser or to come to their office hours.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in East Asian Studies, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	Students of East Asia at Harvard, in whatever program, benefit from a number of unusual resources. Among these are the magnificent collections of the Harvard-Yenching Library\u2014the Chinese collection is perhaps the most comprehensive in the world, while those on Japan and Korea also are imposing. The Harvard-Yenching Institute, in addition to its support of the library, operates programs that bring younger East Asian scholars and graduate students to Harvard. The Fairbank Center for East Asian Research and the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies also have a number of scholars on East Asia in residence annually, and sponsor workshops and other enriching activities. Harvard, moreover, sponsors certain study programs abroad, and the existence of these and other opportunities has led to an increasing number of students spending one of their undergraduate years in East Asia.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Freshmen or sophomores interested in concentrating on East Asia should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Ryuichi Abe, or the Coordinator for EAS, Nicole Escolas. They can also stop by the EAS office at 9 Kirkland Place during office hours, come to the office hours of the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies, or make appointments with them.

aV\u000aProfessor Jill Hooley, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Psychology is the scientific study of the mind, and as such, we investigate the minds of humans and other species. We try to understand the mind at many different levels of analysis, from taking measurements from the brain, through learning about the individual, all the way to understanding groups and organizations. The kinds of questions psychologists attempt to answer are: How do we perceive the physical world? Does our view of it coincide with reality? How do we make sense of the social world? Can we really understand the minds of others? Which others, and do the groups \u201cthey\u201d belong to matter? Why do we pay attention to some things and not others? How do memories form and how do we forget? Can we be said to have a memory even if we can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d? What are the rules by which we reason and think? What\u2019s the role of emotion as expressed in the joy, surprise, sadness, anger and fear of everyday life as well as in depression, schizophrenia, and other disorders? What are the causes of these kinds of disorders, and how can they be treated? Are we rational beings or only boundedly so? Why do we believe in religion, do we have unshakable feelings of morality, and how best should we study our own consciousness? How do all these processes develop from infancy to adulthood? To answer these and other questions about the mind, psychologists pay attention to evolutionary factors, biological bases, cultural and social inputs, as well as the day-to-day situations in which individuals find themselves. Most of the research conducted in Harvard\u2019s Department of Psychology concerns basic psychological processes such as attention, perception, memory, categorization, reasoning, decision-making, language, cognitive and social development, social cognition, intergroup relations, and morality. In addition, some members of the department conduct research on the etiology, development, and treatment of psychopathology. All members of the department share the common goal of understanding mind, brain, and behavior through empirical investigation, and their teaching and research reflect this goal.\u000a	As part of a liberal arts education, the primary goal of the Psychology concentration is to provide students with a fundamental understanding of the human mind.  In the process of doing so, other goals will also be achieved: the skill to critically assess quantitative evidence from experimental and correlational data, to learn to take difficult and previously unstudied problems of mind and society and bring them under experimental scrutiny, to learn to speak and write about questions of great theoretical and social importance that involve the mind. Knowledge of human psychology informs students to be good practitioners of law, education, medicine, business, and life in general.  Thus, the ultimate goal of the concentration is to engage students in the very exciting life of the mind.\u000a	The Department seeks to serve undergraduates with a diverse set of goals. It understands that a small number of concentrators seek to prepare themselves for graduate work in psychology or neuroscience; many plan to attend professional schools of law, medicine, public health, or business; and some see a concentration in Psychology as interesting and valuable intellectually but do not base their future vocational plans upon it. The Department has kept all these reasons in mind in designing its concentration requirements. The requirements have been structured so that students start with an Introductory Course that provides a broad introduction to the field, progress to Foundational Courses that each provide a more focused examination of a sub-area of psychology, and then take Advanced Courses in more specialized areas of interest.\u000aREQUIREMENTS\u000aGeneral Track in PsychologyBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors EligibilityNon-Thesis Option: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aThesis Option: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aCognitive Science TrackRequirements: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000a	The Cognitive Science track is affiliated with the University-wide Mind/Brain/Behavior (MBB) Interfaculty Initiative, and is administered through the Psychology Undergraduate Office.

As such, it is one of the major paths toward bridging the social and life sciences at Harvard. The track reflects the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of learning and research in psychology, emphasizing integration across the sub-disciplines within psychology (social psychology, cognitive psychology, development, psychopathology) as well as connections between psychology and the other life sciences. Students in this track have the opportunity to study the interplay between traditional interests in psychology such as vision, memory, language, emotion, intergroup relations, cooperation, and psychological disorders, and recent developments in neuroscience and evolutionary science.\u000a	To support this learning, the track will provide a strong foundation of basic knowledge in psychology and the life sciences, as well as analytical, quantitative, and research skills scientists in these areas employ. Students will also take more advanced courses in social and cognitive neuroscience and/or evolutionary psychology, and can choose to work in a faculty lab. A thesis option is available for students with strong interests in the research component of the program.\u000aRequired courses:\u000aOther Information:\u000aAdvanced Course Requirement, Limits on lab-based courses: Students may count up to two lab-based courses (any combination of Psychology 910r, Lab Courses, or Psychology 985) for concentration credit as follows: students who choose to meet the research methods course requirement with a Lab Course may only count up to one additional lab-based course toward the Advanced Course requirement; otherwise two lab-based courses may count toward the Advanced Course requirement. Additional research courses may be taken for College elective credit. Students may enroll in Psychology 910r up to a total of three times for any combination of concentration credit and college credit.\u000a			For Honors Eligibility:\u000aNon-thesis option: Same as Cognitive Neuroscience  and Evolutionary Psychology Basic Requirements, plus the following:\u000aDetermination of Departmental Honors: A degree recommendation of Honors will be awarded to students who meet these requirements.

Students who meet the requirements as listed in 3A.1 above at the end of their final semester will receive an Honors recommendation (see below).\u000aMinimum Concentration GPA: Students must have a minimum (i.e., with no rounding) concentration GPA of 3.85. Concentration grade-point averages are calculated from a student's best twelve courses that meet the requirements (e.g., Introductory Course, Foundational Courses, Basic and Research Methods, Advanced Courses), including final semester grades.\u000aThesis option: 14 courses (56 credits). 1A-E same as Cognitive Neuroscience and Evolutionary Psychology Basic Requirements plus the following:\u000aADVISING\u000aThe Department of Psychology offers numerous opportunities for students to obtain advice about the field and concentration. The first stop for information should be the undergraduate website, which is a comprehensive collection of requirements, departmental policies, and advice about navigating through the concentration. House-based concentration advisors are available to students throughout the academic year (see list of concentration advisors by house.) Concentration advising includes discussing concentration requirements, signing Crimson Carts and Plans of Study, helping plan future courses, discussing research opportunities, considering possible career options, and answering other related questions students may have. Students may also get advice and information throughout the year from program staff in the Psychology Undergraduate Office, William James Hall 218. Students may email brief questions to psychology@wjh.harvard.edu.\u000a	Pre-concentrators should read the Advising and Requirements sections of the undergraduate website (links to those sections are on the home page). Posted pre-concentration drop-in advising hours can also be found online. Students can also e-mail psychology@wjh.harvard.edu or stop by the Psychology Undergraduate Office with questions.\u000aRESOURCES\u000aThe Department of Psychology is situated in William James Hall, at the corner of Kirkland Street and Divinity Avenue. Copying machines are available in the basement of the building. Special facilities exist for individual interviews; group studies; observation of infants and children; and for work in the areas of vision and perception, and neuroscience. These laboratories are directed by individual faculty members and access is arranged through them.\u000a	The Psychology Undergraduate Office is located on the second floor of William James Hall (Rooms 218\u2013222) and students can come by during business hours or make an appointment. Students are welcome to come here for general information about the concentration and related matters. The Psychology undergraduate website includes information on concentration requirements, prizes, awards, and volunteer and job opportunities.\u000a	The Department of Psychology has long been committed to active student involvement in departmental activities. Each year, several concentrators serve as student representatives to the departmental Committee on Undergraduate Instruction (CUI). The CUI considers a wide variety of policy matters, and student participation in its deliberations allows concentrators to help plan and review aspects of the undergraduate curriculum and programs.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	The Psychology concentration has an extensive website that includes information about basic and honors concentration requirements and the Psychology General, MBB, and Life Science tracks.

aV\u000aProfessor Jeffrey Miron, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Economics is a social science that is at once broad in its subject matter and unified in its approach to understanding the social world. An economic analysis begins from the premise that individuals have goals and that they pursue those goals as best they can. Economics studies the behavior of social systems\u2014such as markets, corporations, legislatures, and families\u2014as the outcome of interactions through institutions between goal-directed individuals. Ultimately, economists make policy recommendations that they believe will make people better off.\u000a	Traditionally, economics has focused on understanding prices, competitive markets, and the interactions between markets. While topics such as monopolies and antitrust, income inequality, economic growth, and the business cycle continue to be important areas of inquiry, the subject matter of economics has broadened. Today, economists address a remarkable variety of social science questions. Will school vouchers improve the quality of education? Do politicians manipulate the business cycle? What sort of legal regime best promotes economic development? Why do cities have ghettos? What can be done about grade inflation? Why do people procrastinate in saving for retirement\u2014or in doing their homework?\u000a	Economics today is a scientific discipline. Bringing their particular perspective to the questions of social science, economists formulate theories and collect evidence to test these theories against alternative ideas. Doing economic research involves asking questions about the social world and addressing those questions with data and clear-headed logic, employing mathematical and statistical tools whenever possible to aid the analysis.\u000a	An undergraduate education in economics focuses on learning to analyze the world in terms of tradeoffs and incentives\u2014that is, to think like an economist. Students concentrating in economics begin, ordinarily, in their freshman year, with Economics 10a and 10b, the introductory courses in economics. Because marginal conditions hold a central place among economists' analytical tools, prospective economics concentrators are required to complete math at the level of Math 1a. Students who have already met this requirement may choose to continue their study of mathematics in order to prepare for courses that assume familiarity with more advanced topics in mathematics or for graduate study in economics. Students hoping to graduate with honors must complete additional math courses; see the specific requirements below. Freshmen are also encouraged to take the required introductory statistics course. The ability to interpret quantitative data and to understand statistical arguments is essential to understanding the economy. Students who have not completed this requirement their freshman year are advised to fulfill it their sophomore year.\u000a	Concentrators ordinarily take four or five economics courses in their sophomore year. Two courses make up the intermediate theory sequence: one of 1010a or 1011a (Intermediate Microeconomics) and one of 1010b or 1011b (Intermediate Macroeconomics). These courses teach the analytical tools that economists use. The 1011 courses assume a more advanced background in mathematics than the 1010 courses. The third course generally taken in the sophomore year is Economics 970, the Sophomore Tutorial, which is taught in classes of eight to 10 students. The Sophomore Tutorial is an intensive experience aimed at helping concentrators develop the ability to understand the nature of economics research, to discuss economic arguments both orally and in writing, and to start to carry out their own research. Finally, students are advised to fulfill the econometrics requirement (Economics 1123 or 1126) in the sophomore year. This helps students get the most out of their Sophomore Tutorials as they use the tools learned in econometrics.\u000a	Beyond these foundational courses, all concentrators are required to take three additional elective courses in the Economics Department. Students can pursue Honors either by writing a senior thesis or taking the non-thesis Advanced Course Track (ACT); see the specific requirements below. Honors candidates must also take the economics honors exam in the spring of their senior year.\u000a	In recent years, approximately 25 percent of economics concentrators have chosen to write a senior thesis. Senior thesis topics often spring from a question of interest first raised in an economics elective course. Students are therefore strongly advised to take courses before their senior year in areas in which they might want to write their theses.\u000a	Undergraduates are welcome in graduate courses and often do well in them. Because coverage of the professional literature is a primary objective of such courses, they are generally demanding and time-consuming for undergraduates.\u000a	A more complete description of the Economics Department and its requirements can be found in the handbook, Undergraduate Economics at Harvard: A Guide for Concentrators, available on the Economics Undergraduate Program website.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 11 courses (44 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 15 courses (60 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students interested in economics are encouraged to visit the Economics Undergraduate Advising Office, located on the first floor of Littauer Center, for information and advice about economics courses and the economics concentration. The office is headed by Jeffrey Miron\u2014the Director of Undergraduate Studies\u2014five concentration advisors, and the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. Concentration advisors are available in the Economics Undergraduate Advising Office (Littauer 109-116) on a walk-in basis, from 10am to 4pm, Monday through Friday, during the semester; they are happy to respond to any student questions or concerns. Concentration advisors can lift advising holds, approve concentration declaration forms, sign add/drop forms, and advise/approve courses for concentrators from study abroad. More importantly, they can explain Department requirements, discuss students\u2019 academic and research interests, offer advice on course choices, and discuss future plans, such as job possibilities or graduate or professional school.\u000a	Each concentrator has an assigned advisor based on their residential House. Students will hear from their concentration advisor periodically, to inform them of office hours, important deadlines, meetings, and requirements. Students may, at any time, contact their concentration advisor for help or for information. Students are also welcome to seek advice from any of the advisors during walk-in advising office hours.\u000a	For up-to-date information on economics advising, please see the Economics Advising webpage.\u000aSTUDY ABROAD\u000a	The Economics Department permits study abroad for a term or an academic year. It is generally best for students to study abroad during their junior year. Students may earn concentration credit for one course taken while abroad. Students may postpone Economics 970 (Sophomore Tutorial) if they choose to go abroad during their sophomore year.\u000a	After choosing a university and obtaining College approval for planned courses from the Office of International Education, students should visit their concentration advisor during office hours and, if possible, bring course syllabi to the meeting to have the required pre-departure questionnaire approved and signed. The advisor will grant credit toward fulfilling economics concentration requirements for appropriate courses (although some students choose not to fulfill economics concentration requirements while abroad). To count for concentration credit, a course must be primarily economic in content and methodology and roughly equivalent in difficulty to a Harvard Economics Department course. Courses with an intermediate theory prerequisite may count toward the theory prerequisite requirement. Students who write a paper longer than 15 pages for a course can submit the graded paper to their concentration adviser, who may grant writing requirement credit for the course if the paper has substantial economic content.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	An abundance of information is available on the Department website. To declare an economics concentration, students must (1) submit their declaration on my.harvard.edu and then (2) bring a completed copy of the Economics Declaration and Plan of Study form to a concentration advisor for approval.  A more complete description of the Economics Department and its requirements can be found in the handbook, Undergraduate Economics at Harvard: A Guide for Concentrators, available online.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December\u000a	  * Economics does not participate in joint concentrations.

aV\u000aProfessor Courtney Bickel Lamberth, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The Comparative Study of Religion engages enduring questions about religion, human society, and the meaning individuals and communities make in life. The concentration trains students to think critically about religions in interaction with other cultural, historical, intellectual, and social phenomena.  Central problems in a wide range of fields\u2014economics, government, sociology, history, and many others\u2014can only be adequately addressed by taking religion into account. Competency in religious studies indicates the ability to think critically and with historical and cultural learning about the complicated place of religious history, imagination, motivation, and memory in national and international affairs. Such skills have become one marker of an educated person, who is appropriately prepared for the duties and pleasures of democratic citizenship and leadership.\u000a	The Committee on the Study of Religion offers courses on religious traditions from around the world and across time. The program engages a wide range of approaches to the study of religion--humanistic and social scientific--including historical studies, ethnographic studies of contemporary communities, psychology of religion, and close examination of classic texts from major religious traditions. Additionally, courses from other departments can often be counted for credit toward the concentration.\u000a	Students in the concentration develop an understanding of one or two of the major religious traditions of the world through study of sacred books, rituals, and symbols; philosophy and theology; and the lived experiences and history of participants in the tradition. The program stresses the acquisition of certain skills: (1) the arts of reading and interpreting texts, practices and societies; (2) clear writing (essays are a substantial part of the requirements of the sophomore and junior tutorials); and (3) an understanding of the basic modern literature on the theory of religion and of the methods of the study of religious phenomena.\u000a	Concentrators draw up an individual concentration plan of study under the supervision of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, their concentration adviser, at times also in consultation with appropriate members of the Committee on the Study of Religion. There are four options for a concentration: (A) a focus on two religious traditions (or one tradition and one thematic focus), (B) a focus on a single tradition, (C) a joint concentration with religion as the primary field of study, and (D) a joint concentration with another field as the primary field of study. All four programs involve required general, methodological, or comparative courses outside of the major religious tradition(s) being studied. These courses provide analytical tools and knowledge of other traditions that enable students to think with comparative and theoretical imagination about diverse phenomena in religion. Concentration credit for study abroad is possible; students interested in such credit must petition the Committee on the Study of Religion, through the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\u000aOPTIONS\u000aREQUIREMENTSNon-honors: 12 courses (48 credits) / Honors: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aOption A: Two Major Traditions, or One Tradition and a Thematic Focus, in Comparative Context\u000aOption B: One Major Tradition in Comparative Context\u000aOption C: Joint Concentration with Religion as Primary Field\u000aOption D: Joint Concentration with Another Field as Primary Field7 courses (28 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Each student will be assigned a concentration adviser who will meet with the student at the beginning of each term and, when occasion warrants, to assist with the student\u2019s concentration plan.

aV\u000aProfessor Marko Loncar, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Electrical Engineering has long played a critical role in undergirding the innovation that has improved quality of life, supported economic growth and addressed societal problems. Its emergence as a separate field of study in the late 19th century paralleled, and was responsive to, the large-scale introduction of telegraphy and electrical lighting. Electrical engineering has continued to play a pivotal role in power and energy distribution, communications, and computation, even as the power-carrying channels have evolved from heavy metal cables to nanowires or optical fibers, the networks of communications have evolved from wires to wireless to neurons, and electrical switches have evolved from vacuum tubes to transistors to carbon nanotubes. The essential technologies that join us all together\u2014mobile phones, laptops, wireless communications, downloaded videos, light-emitting diodes, electronic displays, the electrical power grid, and ATM transactions\u2014are all evidence of the impact and continual innovation of electrical engineering.\u000a	Electrical Engineering is a broadly diverse field that encompasses, for example, controls, communications, signal processing, circuit design, computer engineering, and electronic and photonic devices. This concentration requires a foundational group of five courses including Engineering Sciences 150, 152, 155, 156, and Computer Science 141. It also requires completion of a minimum of three electrical engineering electives and two additional engineering electives.\u000a	The objectives of the electrical engineering program are to provide students a solid foundation in electrical engineering within the setting of a liberal arts college for preparation for a diverse range of careers in industry and government, or for advanced work in engineering, business, law, or medicine. It enables the acquisition of a broad range of skills and attitudes drawn from the humanities, social sciences, and sciences in addition to engineering, which enhances engineering knowledge and contributes to future leadership and technical success.\u000a	The SB degree program requires a minimum of twenty courses (80 credits). The curriculum is structured with advanced courses building on the knowledge acquired in math, science, and introductory engineering science courses. Concentrators are strongly encouraged to complete the common prerequisite course sequence in their first two years at Harvard. This includes Math (through 1a and 1b; plus 21a and 21b, 23a and 23b, or Applied Mathematics 21a and 21b), Physics (through Physical Sciences 12a and 12b, Physics 15a and 15b, or Applied Physics 50a and 50b), and Computer Science 50. Students are cautioned that it is more important to derive a solid understanding of these basic subjects than to complete them quickly without thorough knowledge; this material is extensively used in many subsequent courses. If in doubt, it may be wise to enroll in the Math 1 sequence rather than proceed to Math 21a or 23a with marginal preparation.\u000aThe SB programs in Electrical Engineering and Engineering Sciences share many course requirements, and there is some flexibility in moving between these programs. To get an early sample of engineering coursework, entering students are invited to enroll in Environmental Science and Engineering 6 (Environmental Science and Engineering), Engineering Sciences 50 (Electrical Engineering), Engineering Sciences 51 (Mechanical Engineering), and Engineering Sciences 53 (Biomedical Engineering). These introductory courses have minimal prerequisites and have been very popular with prospective engineering concentrators. Engineering 50 and 51 have extensive hands-on laboratory sections.\u000a	Upon graduation, students in the Electrical Engineering concentration should demonstrate the following student outcomes:\u000aREQUIREMENTS20 courses (80 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students interested in concentrating in Electrical Engineering should discuss their plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, or the Undergraduate Academic Programs Manager. Each undergraduate who elects to concentrate in Electrical Engineering is assigned a faculty adviser depending on the student's area of specialization. The faculty adviser might also be a member of the Undergraduate Engineering Committee, whose members have the responsibility for reviewing departmental Plans of Study. If students do not request a change in adviser, they have the same adviser until they graduate. Each student is reassigned to another faculty member while the original faculty adviser is on leave. It is expected that students will discuss their Plans of Study and progress with their Director of Undergraduate Studies or Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies at the beginning of each term. Students may seek advice from their faculty adviser, the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, or the Academic Programs Manager at any time.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Further information is available from the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Marko Loncar, loncar@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 495-5798, the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Christopher Lombardo, lombardo@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-5185; or the Undergraduate Academic Programs Manager, Kathy Lovell, klovell@seas.harvard.edu, (617) 496-1524.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December\u000a	Electrical Engineering was a new concentration in 2012-13.

aV\u000aKathy Richman, Director of Undergraduate StudiesElvira G. Di Fabio, Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	In the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures (RLL), undergraduates discover the development of literatures, cultures, critical approaches, and, of course, language \u2013 from the oldest manuscripts to the avant-garde \u2013 in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.  The department offers courses in Catalan up to the intermediate level as well.  Students interested in advanced work in more than one language and tradition may pursue the Romance Studies track.\u000a	Courses in RLL invite undergraduates to engage deeply and critically with all kinds of texts and questions \u2013 from Don Quixote to the legacies of colonialism and the politics of post-war Europe \u2013 in a language other than English.  Students develop an understanding of the ways in which rhetorical devices like metaphor and hyperbole make cultural artifacts \u2013 from everyday materials to works of art \u2013 richer, more complex, and more demanding of in-depth analysis.  Concentrators find RLL a challenging and supportive environment.  Here, they learn to strengthen their capacity to interact in meaningful ways with people in dozens of countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.  The skills in analysis, critical thinking, and communication which RLL students develop prepare them to act as informed and sophisticated global citizens.\u000a	Undergraduates who arrive at Harvard with advanced language skills begin with courses which provide a panoramic introduction to the literature, film, and culture of different regions and eras, all taught in the particular Romance language. They may also take more specialized courses on specific topics or movements. Those who enter with a foundation in one or more Romance languages begin with intermediate courses in language and culture, which focus on perfecting communication skills and cultural understanding in preparation for the advanced courses described above. Undergraduates who begin a new language at Harvard are also able to complete the concentration in RLL.\u000a	In beginning and intermediate courses in French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Catalan, students learn to communicate accurately and effectively in their chosen language.  Equally importantly, they become more attuned listeners.  As they develop an understanding of how people in different communities in the Romance-speaking world conceive of artistic, social, ethical, and political issues, their own sense of self grows and evolves.  In RLL, undergraduates achieve the linguistic and cultural fluency so crucial in today\u2019s globalized world.\u000a	RLL offers summer programs taught by our own faculty in Paris, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Milan/Siena, and Recife. Students enjoy intensive, in-depth, location-specific curricula while earning credits that count as two term-time Harvard courses. Many find these programs an enriching and useful component to completing the concentration.\u000a	Concentrators in RLL work closely with faculty to develop and carry out research projects.  Senior theses and independent studies address a wide range of topics, for example: communication strategies for Zika prevention in Brazil; racial and gender identities and modes of performance among expatriate musicians in Paris; self-fashioning in Montaigne and Milton; reading autofiction in Borges and Barthes through the lens of social media; and ambiguities in medicine and fiction in 20th-century Latin America.\u000a	An undergraduate degree in RLL prepares students for work in the following areas, among others:\u000a	Medicine \u2013 internships and residencies abroad; international medical humanitarian organizations and voluntary programs; public health in the U.S. and overseas\u000a	Arts \u2013 museum work; filmmaking; publishing; journalism; fiction and other creative writing\u000a	Law \u2013 U.S. firms based abroad; international firms in the U.S.; human rights organizations; non-governmental organizations; foundations; foreign service and diplomacy\u000a	Teaching and Scholarship \u2013 bilingual and secondary schools; graduate programs leading to careers in teaching and research at colleges and universities\u000a	Business and Public Administration \u2013 international banking and investment firms; non-governmental organizations; foundations; advertising; consulting; import and export of specialty foods and wine.\u000aCONCENTRATING IN ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES\u000a	A student concentrating in RLL will choose one of five Special Fields as the focus for work in the concentration, as follows:\u000a	Concentrators will take a sequence of courses in language and culture, plus a sequence of courses in literature, film, and culture and society in their chosen Special Field.  (General requirements are outlined below.)  In consultation with the Special Field Adviser and the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS), concentrators develop and submit a Plan of Study that reflects both the scope of the special field and their individual interests and goals.\u000aCONCENTRATION REQUIREMENTS\u000aBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aCategory A. Language and Culture courses: Two courses at the 40, 50, or 60 level. A maximum of two courses at this level may be counted toward the concentration requirement. A student who places out of category A must replace the two required courses with courses in categories B, D or E, or approved Gateway courses. See 5.g below, for information about concentration language requirement.\u000aCategory B. Literature, film, and culture and society: Two courses at the 70 level.\u000aCategory C.

aV\u000aProfessor Zhiming Kuang, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Engineering innovation has long played a critical role in enhancing social progress and bringing about an improved quality of life. Within the past 50 years, the pace and impact of innovation have increased dramatically, facilitating modern health, energy, transportation, communications, and computational infrastructures that knit together the countries of the world. At the same time, engineering innovation has enabled dramatic advances in basic science. Imaging and manufacturing structures at the nanoscales, near-lossless transmission of information, and unprecedented levels of computational power have led to fantastic new discoveries. These types of technologies, for instance, have allowed us to decode the genome, understand the formation of galaxies, and make correlations between social networks and underlying human psychology. In the 21st century, rapid and efficient access to the new innovations, necessary to tackle today's myriad challenges, has become even more imperative. Equally important is the need to educate both those who will be future engineering innovators and those who will use those innovations, deploy them, and make critical legal and political decisions about them.\u000a	Engineering has evolved over the years to not only dive deeply into specific fields, but also to seek out solutions to real-world problems by combining concepts from a broad range of scientific inquiries and innovations. For example, robotics is a highly interdisciplinary field that straddles multiple traditional engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and materials engineering and computer science. While roboticists have traditionally been trained in specific engineering disciplines, next generation roboticists must tackle large complex systems comprising multiple parts that span myriad disciplines\u2014from the mechanical underpinnings of the physical device, to electronic control, materials properties, and high-level algorithms\u2014all of which must work in concert to achieve broad-level objectives while adhering to numerous constraints. Alternative energy is another growing and immensely important field that requires integration of solutions across a wide range of science and engineering disciplines. Topics range from understanding the inherent properties of materials and devices that harness the sun's rays to thinking about challenges associated with large-scale production and distribution of electricity, and addressing both the societal and environmental impacts of new technologies. The Engineering Sciences concentration is ideally positioned to provide students with both the breadth and depth of study needed to excel in these and other exciting integrative areas of engineering within the liberal arts setting of Harvard.\u000a	Harvard offers two degrees in Engineering Sciences: the Bachelor of Arts (AB) and the Bachelor of Science (SB). The degree requirements differ for each of these programs: the AB program requires between 14 and 16 courses (56-64 credits) and the SB program requires 20 courses (80 credits). Students in the Engineering Sciences AB program specialize in one of four engineering tracks: biomedical sciences and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, engineering physics, or mechanical and materials science and engineering. Students interested in an AB degree may also consider the Biomedical Engineering concentration and the Environmental Science and Engineering concentration, which are also listed in this publication. Students pursuing the SB degree in the Engineering Sciences concentration typically specialize in one of two tracks: bioengineering or environmental science and engineering. Students interested in an SB degree specializing in Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering should refer directly to those concentrations, which are also listed in this publication. Students may also apply to a cross-disciplinary track within the Engineering Sciences SB program, which provides the opportunity to learn between or across traditional engineering areas.\u000a	The SB degree program requires a minimum of 20 courses (80 credits). The curriculum is structured with advanced courses building on the knowledge acquired in math, science, and introductory engineering science courses. Concentrators are encouraged to complete the common prerequisite course sequence in their first two years at Harvard. This includes Math (through 1a and 1b; plus 21a and 21b, 23a and 23b, or Applied Mathematics 21a and 21b), Physics (through Applied Physics 50a and 50b, Physical Sciences 12a and 12b, or Physics 15a and 15b), and Computer Science 50. Students are cautioned that it is more important to derive a solid understanding of these basic subjects than to complete them quickly without thorough knowledge; this material is extensively used in many subsequent courses. If in doubt, it may be wise to enroll in the Math 1 sequence rather than proceed to Math 21a or 23a with marginal preparation.\u000a	The SB and AB degree programs in Engineering Sciences share many course requirements, and there is some flexibility in moving between these programs. To get an early sample of engineering coursework, entering students are invited to enroll in Environmental Science and Engineering 6 (Environmental Science and Engineering), Engineering Sciences 50 (Electrical Engineering), Engineering Sciences 51 (Mechanical Engineering), and Engineering Sciences 53 (Biomedical Engineering). These introductory courses have minimal prerequisites, and have been very popular with prospective engineering concentrators. Engineering Sciences 50 and 51 have extensive hands-on laboratory sections; and Environmental Science and Engineering 6 and Engineering Sciences 50 satisfy requirements for the Program in General Education.\u000a	The Engineering Sciences program seeks to educate future leaders that have the technical background necessary to develop and critically evaluate the next wave of engineering innovations; to apply these innovations to important global and local problems; and to make informed decisions about them in a societal context.\u000a	Upon graduation, students in the Engineering Sciences AB concentration should demonstrate the following student outcomes:\u000a	Upon graduation, students in the Engineering Sciences SB concentration should demonstrate the following student outcomes:\u000aOPTIONSBachelor of Arts in Engineering Sciences\u000aBachelor of Science in Engineering Sciences\u000aREQUIREMENTSBachelor of Arts (AB) in Engineering Sciences: 14-16 courses (56-64 credits)\u000aBachelor of Science (SB) in Engineering Sciences: 20 courses (80 credits)\u000a	Prospective concentrators are encouraged to make early contact with concentration representatives. Students wishing to enter the concentration must obtain the appropriate Engineering Sciences SB plan of study and related instructions from the Office of Academic Programs  (Pierce Hall 110) or online at http://www.seas.harvard.edu/academics/undergraduate and review materials before meeting with an Assistant/Associate Director or the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students should be aware that the Engineering Sciences SB degree is more demanding than typical AB degrees, requiring 20 courses (80 credits).\u000a	Students typically follow specific guidelines provided for one of two tracks: Bioengineering or Environmental Science and Engineering. Students interested in an SB degree specializing in Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering should refer directly to those concentrations. Students may also apply to a cross-disciplinary track in their junior or senior years, which provides the opportunity to learn between or across traditional engineering areas.\u000a	In addition to the courses listed specifically below, other relevant and/or advanced courses may be approved by petition in the context of a particular plan of study. A petition must propound in writing a coherent and persuasive argument for the intellectual merit of the proposal in question.\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students interested in concentrating in Engineering Sciences should discuss their plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Assistant/Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, or the Undergraduate Academic Programs Manager. Each undergraduate who elects to concentrate in Engineering Sciences is assigned a faculty adviser depending on the student's track. The faculty adviser might also be a member of the Undergraduate Engineering Committee, whose members have the responsibility for reviewing departmental Plans of Study. If students do not request a change in adviser, they have the same adviser until they graduate. Each student is reassigned to another faculty member while the original faculty adviser is on leave. It is expected that students will discuss their Plans of Study and progress with their Director of Undergraduate Studies or Assistant/Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies at the beginning of each term. Students may also seek advice from their faculty adviser, the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Assistant/Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, or the Academic Programs Manager at any time.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Further information is available from the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Engineering Sciences, Prof. TBD (es-dus@seas.harvard.edu) or the relevant Assistant/Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies: for Mechanical and Materials Science and Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dr. Christopher Lombardo (lombardo@seas.harvard.edu); for Bioengineering, Dr. Linsey Moyer (lmoyer@seas.harvard.edu); for Environmental Science and Engineering, Dr. Patrick Ulrich (pulrich@seas.harvard.edu).

aV\u000aProfessor Daria Khitrova, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The concentration in Slavic Literatures and Cultures offers you the opportunity to study the great works and cultural traditions, past and present, of Russia and the other Slavic countries, especially Ukraine, Poland, and the Czech Republic. These countries share a rich cultural life as well as a turbulent and fascinating history. In the Slavic concentration, you will develop proficiency in Russian or another Slavic language such as Czech, Polish, or Ukrainian; you will learn to read literary works in the original language, gain valuable experience for working and traveling abroad, and come to understand these cultures and the important role they have played in the modern world. The concentration requirements are five courses in Russian or another Slavic language, three courses of tutorial, one survey course in Russian or another Slavic literature, two electives, and a senior project in the final year. (Native speakers and students with advanced language preparation may substitute additional literature courses for a substantial part of the language requirement.) Study abroad, whether a summer or a semester, is strongly encouraged and easily accommodated within the concentration.\u000a	Your Slavic tutorials will give you a rigorous introduction to contemporary methodologies of reading texts and studying foreign cultures. All tutorials in the Slavic department are taught exclusively by full-time faculty. The sophomore tutorial (spring term only) will introduce you to major issues in the field of Slavic studies, including methods of interpreting literary texts as well as visual culture, and the forces structuring national and regional identities. The junior tutorial introduces students to shorter canonical texts of Slavic literature, read in the original. In order to fulfill your tutorial requirements, in your junior year you will also take one 100-level course with readings in Russian (or another Slavic language). Normally, the 100-level course is taken in the fall, the tutorial in the spring, both in the junior year, but students who study abroad or have other constraints on their schedules may work with the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) to make other arrangements. Many of our concentrators combine a love of literature with a strong interest in other disciplines, and we highlight the interdisciplinary nature of Slavic studies by incorporating history, politics, and visual culture into our tutorials and other department courses. In the senior year, non-honors concentrators will design a fall-term capstone project in consultation with the DUS, allowing them to study with a faculty member from the department and write a 25\u201330 page senior project. Honors candidates will work with a faculty member for the entire senior year and write a thesis. The department awards prizes for superior honors theses.\u000a	In addition to the required survey course in Russian literature, students are encouraged to use their two elective courses to explore a broad variety of subjects offered by the department, including one-author seminars on Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Nabokov, Chekhov, and others; the interwar avant-gardes in literature, art, and film; the cultures of great European cities such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Prague; twentieth-century Ukrainian literature and its political contexts; the culture of Medieval Rus\u2019; Russian women readers and writers; Russian theater and ballet; Russian and Central European film; and the traditions of Slavic intellectual history from anarchism to Communism and political dissent. Many of our courses cover aspects of Slavic critical theory (formalism, structuralism, Bakhtin, cultural semiotics), as well as other contemporary theoretical approaches to literature.\u000a	Study abroad, though not required, is strongly encouraged by the department, and the majority of our concentrators spend time abroad, typically during their junior year or in the summer after their sophomore or junior year. Slavic department faculty currently run one summer abroad program each year in Prague and Tbilisi. Many of our students also study in Russia or Central Europe with other programs such as the Bard-Smolny Program, the American Council of Teachers of Russian (ACTR), or the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE); entrance to these programs is competitive, but Harvard students have traditionally done well. Credit toward concentration requirements is granted to those who successfully complete such programs; in order to receive concentration credit for this or any other external study, the student must receive permission in advance from the DUS.\u000a	The department welcomes all students with an interest in Slavic languages and cultures, and is happy to accept late transfers so long as the applicants have already begun language study. We also welcome joint concentrators (see below). Although the undergraduate concentration will prepare you for graduate study in Slavic, comparative literature, history, and other programs, many of our students follow careers in other areas, including medicine, law, business, and government; they find that the experience of learning a language and getting to know a foreign culture greatly expands their opportunities for work and travel.\u000aREQUIREMENTS\u000aSlavic Literatures and CulturesBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aSlavic Literatures and CulturesRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aJoint Concentration: Slavic Languages and Literatures as primary field: 11 courses (44 credits)\u000aJoint Concentration: Slavic Languages and Literatures as allied field: 8 courses (32 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	The Director of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for advising the concentrators in all three years.

aV\u000aProfessor Stephanie Burt, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aProfessor Kelly Rich (fall), Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The undergraduate program introduces students to the full breadth of imaginative literature written in the English language from the eighth century to its more recent dispersal around the globe. Whether engaged with literary giants such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Dickinson, Keats, and Woolf or in exploration of less famous authors, students in the English program have a rare opportunity to combine aesthetic pleasure, intellectual stimulation, and ethical deliberation in their plan of study. In their first three terms concentrators take three common ground courses that integrate genre and modes, historical periods, and geographic dispersal in a way that lends coherence to an otherwise vast field. Because of their small size, these courses offer students sustained attention that can help them learn to use the vocabulary, and the analytical tools, for discussing literature and for writing critical essays. Moving out from this foundation in the discipline, students explore English literature and language through electives, guided in their choices by a faculty adviser.\u000a	A degree in English prepares students for any field in which careful reading, clear thinking, and persuasive writing are valued. Our concentrators regularly go on to graduate school and to successful careers in business, law, education, medicine, and other fields too numerous to list. Sharpening one\u2019s powers of discernment as well as widening one\u2019s intellectual horizons is at the heart of a liberal education. Such an education, to which literature is central, prepares the student for life as an engaged, intelligently caring citizen of the world.\u000a	The program offers a wide array of creative writing classes in poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and work for the screen and stage. Although students are admitted by application only, the classes are open to all undergraduates, including non-concentrators.\u000a	Concentrators who pursue an honors degree have the opportunity to write a senior thesis, which may take the form of an investigation of a critical topic or a creative writing project (which requires a separate application). All theses are directed by a professor in the English faculty. Honors seniors who choose not to write a thesis have the option of taking two undergraduate seminars in place of the senior tutorial.\u000a	English concentrators can pursue either the Elective Program or the Honors Program. The Elective Program allows more scope for course selection within and outside the English Department. Students in the Honors Program engage in more intensive study through seminars and the thesis options. A grade point average of 3.40 or higher in the concentration is required in the Honors Program, beginning in the junior year. A third option, for Honors candidates only, is a joint concentration, which culminates in a thesis supervised jointly by a member of the English department and a member of the allied department (see below.) A grade point average of 3.60 or higher is required for the joint concentration.\u000aREQUIREMENTS\u000aElective Program: 11 courses (44 credits)\u000aHonors Program: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aJoint Concentration: 8 courses (32 credits) in English\u000a	Upon approval from the department\u2019s Undergraduate Program Office, honors candidates may combine a concentration in English with a concentration in another department, supervised by advisers in each department. It is a challenging undertaking, in part because joint concentrators are expected to take more courses than other students. Ordinarily, only students with a concentration GPA of 3.6 or above, an overall strong record, and a clearly formulated project across two disciplines will receive approval. A joint senior thesis is required.\u000a	Joint concentrators may declare English to be either their primary or allied concentration; the requirements are the same for both. Students are expected to take the junior tutorial in English. The senior tutorial will be administered by the primary department, but even if English is the allied department, an English faculty member will be a joint adviser of the thesis. Decisions about each tutorial and the entire shape of the joint degree depend on close collaboration between the two departments at every stage.Students interested in declaring a joint concentration must complete a change of concentration, which must be approved by both departments and by the student\u2019s Resident Dean. For further information contact DUS Stephanie Burt (burt@fas.harvard.edu).\u000aADVISING\u000a	The English Department is committed to providing high quality advising to undergraduate concentrators, prospective concentrators and any Harvard student interested in the study of English literature. The Undergraduate Program Office assigns each sophomore, junior, and senior concentrator to a faculty adviser.

aV\u000aDr. Anya Bernstein Bassett, Director of Studies\u000a	Social Studies was founded in 1960 by a distinguished group of faculty who believed that the study of the social world requires an integration of the disciplines of history, political science, economics, sociology, and anthropology. For over five decades, Social Studies has brought together outstanding teachers and intellectually engaged students who share a fascination with social science research and theory and a deep interest in applying social science to contemporary social, economic, and political problems.\u000a	The common introduction to Social Studies is Social Studies 10, which introduces students to some of the thinkers who have durably shaped the way we understand modern society. Students examine the development of modern moral, political, and economic ideas and they consider the role of the individual in modern society, studying foundational texts by Smith, Mill, Tocqueville, Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, Fanon, Beauvoir, Foucault, Fanon, and Habermas. Throughout Social Studies 10, students are taught to read theoretical arguments carefully and critically and to juxtapose them against historical developments and social experience. Social Studies 10 is taught both in lecture and in small group tutorials where discussion and writing skills are emphasized.\u000a	The purpose of the junior tutorials in Social Studies is to immerse students in a detailed and focused study of an empirical, theoretical, or historical topic in the social sciences. Junior tutorials also teach social science methodology, providing students with instruction on research techniques and offering them experience in conducting primary research in preparation for their senior theses.\u000a	Students develop an individualized focus field in consultation with their academic adviser. They identify an area of interest (for example, inequality, development, or modern social theory) and create a plan of study. A Social Studies plan of study includes a minimum of four courses, normally drawn from at least two social science departments and including at least one course on a historical topic. Students may petition to take social science courses taught in non-social science departments or courses offered at some of Harvard\u2019s professional schools. A student who is studying inequality might take one course in sociology, one course in economics, one course in history, and one course at the Harvard Kennedy School. A student who is studying development might take two courses in economics, one in anthropology, and one in history. A student of social theory might take one course in philosophy, one course in history, and two courses in government (including one on the history of political thought).\u000a	In the senior year, all Social Studies concentrators enroll in a one-on-one tutorial (Social Studies 99) in preparation for researching and writing a senior thesis. This is a requirement for all concentrators.\u000a	All sophomores considering concentrating in Social Studies must take Social Studies 10a: Introduction to Social Studies, in the fall term. This course is a prerequisite for submitting a Declaration of Intent, which is due in mid-October for students who are planning to declare Social Studies as their concentration in November.\u000a	Transfer students and second-semester sophomores seeking to change concentrations can submit a Declaration of Intent to Social Studies on the first day of classes in the spring term (January 28th, 2019). If the Declaration of Intent is approved, those students may become Social Studies concentrators immediately, but will need to wait to start Social Studies 10 in the fall of their junior year. First semester juniors can submit a Declaration of Intent by the first day of classes in the fall (September 4th, 2018) and may also become Social Studies concentrators immediately.\u000aREQUIREMENTS13 courses (52 credits)\u000aGeneral Examination: An oral examination taken at the end of the senior year which includes a defense of the thesis and a comprehensive discussion of the student\u2019s focus area in Social Studies.\u000aJoint Concentrations\u000a	Social Studies allows joint concentrations with interdisciplinary programs that include social science faculty (African and African American Studies, The Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, East Asian Studies, Religion, and South Asian Studies), and Philosophy. We do not allow joint concentrations with science or humanities departments or with social science departments that we share faculty with (anthropology, economics, government, history, or sociology).\u000aADVISING\u000a	Each student entering the concentration is assigned an advisor who sits on the Social Studies Board of Advisers and is responsible for helping the student plan his or her course of study. In the first semester of concentration, the advisor is that student\u2019s sophomore tutor. Whenever possible, the same advisor continues to serve in this capacity until the student graduates. When this is not possible, another advisor is assigned who shares interests with the student. Students must meet with their advisors at least three times a year to discuss course selection, their focus field, and their plan of study; more frequent meetings are strongly encouraged. The Director of Studies heads the Board of Advisors.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Social Studies, please go to www.socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu or visit the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	For more information, contact the Assistant Director of Studies for Freshmen and Sophomores, Dr. Bonnie Talbert, or the Undergraduate Program Administrator, Kate Anable, on the third floor of William James Hall (617-495-2163).\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December

aV\u000aProfessor Frank Keutsch, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) is an interdisciplinary program with the goal of understanding, predicting, and responding to natural and human-induced environmental change. Addressing environmental issues such as global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, or local and regional air and water pollution requires perspectives from a diverse set of scientific disciplines including atmospheric physics and chemistry, oceanography, glaciology, hydrology, geophysics, ecology, and biogeochemistry. This program is structured around the view that the environmental system is comprised of a complex set of chemical, physical, and biological interactions, made even more complicated by the various activities of human society. Through exploration of the underlying processes and feedbacks within the Earth system, and with a range of approaches from theory and modeling to experiments and observations, students are trained to think about environmental processes in an integrated fashion, preparing them to manage the environmental challenges we face.\u000a	At its core, Environmental Science and Engineering exemplifies the pursuit of a technical liberal arts degree. In order to better understand and address environmental challenges, environmental scientists and engineers draw on core knowledge from other closely related fields to develop technical solutions and advance innovations in environmental measurements, modeling, and control. This cross-disciplinary nature is reflected in the fact that many of Harvard\u2019s ESE faculty are jointly appointed or affiliated in other Schools or departments in FAS. The liberal arts nature of the discipline is reflected in the flexible degree requirements of the concentration. Students have the intellectual freedom to select a program that provides fundamentals in ESE that are aligned with their specific interests. Working closely with their concentration advisers, students develop a plan of study consisting of core courses from within the ESE program and approved electives from the closely related fields like Earth and Planetary Sciences, Integrative Biology, and other engineering disciplines and natural sciences to best support their individual academic goals.\u000aThe AB degree consists of 14 courses (56 credits). Concentrators study the fundamental processes underlying environmental systems, including atmospheric sciences and climate dynamics; pollution of our air, water, and soil; and the development of sustainable energy systems. Throughout their coursework, students learn to apply these principles to understand and model complex environmental problems and to mitigate human impacts on the environment. In brief, concentrators are required to take a fundamental set of introductory math, physics, and chemistry courses as the foundation of their studies (6 of the 14 required courses). Students also take one foundational course (ESE 6, or one of a small number of appropriate Gen Ed courses by petition) to provide an introduction to the field. The remaining 7 courses are selected from a list of approved electives from across the breadth of the ESE course offerings, as well as related natural sciences. To provide a core foundation in environmental science and engineering, all students will be strongly recommended to take at least one course on environmental physics and at least one course on environmental chemistry.

aV\u000aJocelyn Viterna, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aHilary Holbrow, Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Sociology is the study of society, of the social frameworks within which we live our lives. It is a study of social life at every level, from two-person relationships to the rise and fall of nations and civilizations.  More than any other discipline it is a meeting place of the social sciences, combining its own ideas and methods with insights from history, anthropology, economics, political science, and psychology in an extended examination of the ways societies work\u2014or fail to work.  Offering a comprehensive view of the social world, sociology is a cornerstone of a liberal arts education.\u000a	Our students receive instruction in classical and contemporary social theory along with cutting-edge qualitative and quantitative methods.  Course emphases range widely from the theoretical to the applied and incorporate an array of approaches, including field-based sociology, quantitative analysis, ethnography, historical and comparative studies, computer-based analysis, and theoretical explorations.  Students gain valuable skills in data collection, analysis and write-up.  Sociology nurtures question formation and critical thinking since its mixed-methods approach encourages a questioning of empirical data.  Students also learn how to apply sociological analysis to real-world issues \u2013 whether from third world development to corporate capitalism, or from crime in the streets to crime on Capitol Hill.\u000a	We prepare students to develop sociological questions and to design and conduct systematic and rigorous research which they pursue through course projects and senior theses.  Students have opportunities to engage in fieldwork throughout the curriculum.  Required courses emphasize research methodologies and data analysis, including the junior tutorial where students engage in an original research project.  There are multiple opportunities for students to gain valuable research experience including RA work on faculty projects.  This focus on research and fieldwork bolsters both a \u2018hands on\u2019 approach to learning while also exposing students the production of sociological knowledge.\u000a	The Department of Sociology at Harvard has a diverse and distinguished faculty. Our faculty includes the world\u2019s foremost experts in race, ethnicity and immigration, inequality, economic sociology and organizations, urban poverty and the city, gender and family, crime and punishment, social movements and social change, politics, work, culture, social networks, comparative and historical sociology, and sociological theory.  Students may choose to take courses in a variety of areas or they may put together a focused program of study reflecting their own particular interests.\u000a	The concentration takes pride in its advising system, which allows for personal attention to students. It also affords substantial access to faculty and administrators and flexibility in meeting individual intellectual agendas.\u000aSociology concentrators go on to a variety of occupations, professional and academic, including law, medicine, education, business, consulting, finance, public health, journalism, and work in non-profit organizations and the public sector.  Sociology\u2019s broad perspective is particularly valuable in our increasingly global inter-dependent world.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aJOINT CONCENTRATIONS\u000a	Joint concentrations are permitted pending approval from the Committee on Undergraduate Degrees.  However, the aims of such concentrations can often be met as well or better through course work, the honors thesis topic, or by pursuing a secondary field.  Sociology can serve as either the primary or allied field.\u000aNote: A joint concentration is always an honors concentration.

aV\u000aProfessor Paul Moorcroft, Head Tutorwww.espp.fas.harvard.edu\u000a	The concentration in Environmental Science and Public Policy (ESPP) is designed to provide a multidisciplinary introduction to current problems of the environment. It is founded on the premise that the ability to form rational judgments concerning many of the complex challenges confronting society today involving the environment requires both an understanding of the underlying scientific and technical issues and an appreciation for the relevant economic, political, legal, historical, and ethical dimensions. All students have to satisfy a core of requirements in the physical, biological, and social sciences and mathematics. Depending on preparation, students may be encouraged to substitute more advanced courses for these requirements. In consultation with their concentration advisor, students also develop an individual plan of study for a series of advanced courses around a particular field of specialization. Through their field of specialization, students develop expertise in a particular field of study relating to the environment.*\u000a	In the junior year, students take one or more seminars to complement their field of specialization. The seminars are envisaged as a central integrating component of the concentration. The seminars cover a number of current environmental issues, comprehensively and in depth. They are taught by faculty from a number of departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and from several of the professional schools, including the Kennedy School of Government, the School of Public Health, and the Graduate School of Design and the Business School. Topics covered change from year to year, but have included policy issues relating to environmental health, ecology and land use, renewable energy, conservation and biodiversity, and environmental crises, climate change and population flight.\u000a	In the senior year, students undertake a capstone project in which they conduct an in-depth examination of a particular environmental issue consistent with their field of specialization, applying skills and knowledge gained in their courses and tutorial experiences. For students wishing to be considered for honors, the capstone project consists of a year-long 8-credit course senior thesis, while for non-honors students the typical requirement is a one-course term-paper or equivalent.\u000a	The concentration is overseen by a Committee on Degrees functioning as a Board of Tutors including representatives from other departments of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and from other Schools as appropriate to ensure the requisite breadth of the program.\u000a	*To the level that would enable them to pursue graduate level study in the relevant discipline(s) if they choose to do so.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aHonors Requirements: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	At the beginning of the first term of concentration, the Head Tutor assigns each student to one of the faculty members of the ESPP Board of Tutors who will act as their concentration advisor. These assignments are based on the student's interests and their current intended field of specialization. For many students, their interests and planned field of specialization will evolve over time. We view this evolution as an integral part of the ESPP advising process. If desired, students may be subsequently re-assigned to an advisor more appropriate for the student's developing field of specialization.\u000a	Students are expected to meet individually with their advisor at least once each term to discuss their plan of study and their resulting course selections, research opportunities, and other academic matters. However, students are encouraged to meet with their advisers more often throughout the year as their interests and desired field of specialization develops. The advisor's signature on study cards is required. Students may also seek advice from any member of the Board of Tutors in Environmental Science and Public Policy.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	The concentration\u2019s physical and administrative home is located in the Harvard University Center for Environment. The Center serves the larger Harvard community and provides a focus for interdisciplinary, cross-faculty research and education. The center draws its strength from faculty members and students from across the University and complements the environmental education and research activities of the community of scholars based in Harvard\u2019s academic units. Stewarded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Center is designed to serve the entire Harvard community by developing and facilitating projects and activities in the areas of environmental education, research, and outreach\u2014adding the value of an integrated, collaborative approach to traditional academic pursuits.\u000a	The Center\u2019s website www.environment.harvard.edu provides a wealth of information resources, including: an on-line guide to environmental studies; courses; student groups; faculty and researchers; centers at Harvard; and electronic list serves for environmental events.

aV\u000aRichard Delacy, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	A concentration in South Asian Studies enables students to develop a critical understanding of the diverse cultures, histories, languages and literatures of South Asia, which includes Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tibet. South Asia is home to more than a billion people and some of the world\u2019s most fascinating and important civilizations. Its influence has extended historically from Central, East, and Southeast Asia to Europe and North America, which today have vibrant South Asian diasporas. The study of South Asia is an increasingly important area of academic inquiry, especially in recent decades as the region emerges as a global cultural, economic, and political power.\u000a	The concentration offers a range of possibilities for students interested in studying South Asia. Students interested in the arts and humanities may choose to study modern and/or pre-modern South Asia from the disciplinary perspectives of history, history of art, literature, music, philosophy, and/or religion. Students interested in the social sciences may create academic programs which combine the study of languages, literatures, and cultures with course work in anthropology, economics, government, public health, sociology, and/or urban planning.\u000a	In addition, joint concentrations with South Asian Studies and another department are possible with the approval of both departments. The department also offers a secondary field in South Asian Studies, as well as language citations in Hindi-Urdu, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Tibetan.\u000a	There are two concentration options.\u000aOption A: South Asian Languages, Literatures, and Cultures 11 courses (44 credits), 13 courses for honors (52 credits) is for students who wish to focus intensively on learning a major South Asian language, its textual traditions, and broad socio-cultural contexts. The most common choices here are Hindi-Urdu, Sanskrit, Tamil, or Tibetan.\u000a	Students who choose Hindi-Urdu as their primary focus should take a full year of Hindi-Urdu 101 no later than their sophomore year. In subsequent years, they will continue their study of Hindi-Urdu and work out a program of study, with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or a designated adviser, which draws upon a range of courses in South Asian Studies and related fields.\u000a	Students who choose Sanskrit as their primary focus should take introductory Sanskrit (Sanskrit 101a and 101b) no later than their sophomore year. Beyond the study of Sanskrit, students will work out a program of study, with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or a designated adviser, which draws upon a range of courses in South Asian Studies and related fields.\u000a	Students who choose Tamil as their primary focus should take Tamil 101a and 101b no later than their sophomore year. In subsequent years, they will continue their study of Tamil and work out a program of study, with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or a designated adviser, which draws upon a range of courses in South Asian Studies and related fields.\u000a	Students who choose Tibetan as their primary focus should take Tibetan 101a and 101b no later than the sophomore year.  In subsequent years, they will continue their study of Tibetan and work out a program of study, with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or a designated adviser, which draws upon a range of courses in South Asian Studies and related fields.\u000aOption B: South Asian Studies 11 courses (44 credits), 13 for honors (52 credits) is for students who wish to gain a broad understanding of South Asia. While students may develop a particular area of focus or expertise, the emphasis in this option is on wide-ranging and interdisciplinary studies that are essential to understanding this increasingly important part of our contemporary world.\u000a	In this option, language study in Hindi-Urdu, Sanskrit, Tamil, or Tibetan is required. In special cases, another language may be substituted if it is directly related to South Asian Studies and offered by an academic program approved by the department. In addition to the study of a South Asian language, students will work out a program of study, with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or a designated adviser, drawing upon courses in South Asian Studies offered by various departments within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\u000a	A Joint Concentration 9 courses (36 credits) allows students to combine training in South Asian languages and cultures with a particular discipline in another department. The program of study is jointly agreed upon by both departments.\u000aThe Secondary Field in South Asian Studies 5 courses (20 credits) is a more flexible way for students to study South Asia. It maintains the structure of the concentration, with an emphasis on South Asian Languages, Literatures, and Cultures or South Asian Studies, without the obligation of a joint thesis or culminating project.\u000aLanguage Citations are awarded in Hindu-Urdu, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Tibetan, upon completion of four (16 credits) courses beyond the introductory year.\u000aREQUIREMENTS\u000aSouth Asian Languages, Literatures, and CulturesBasic Requirements11 courses (44 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility13 courses (52 credits)\u000aSouth Asian StudiesBasic Requirements11 courses (44 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility13 courses (52 credits)\u000aJoint Concentration Requirements9 courses (36 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students are assigned a faculty adviser based on their area of study.

aV\u000aDr. Ruth Goldstein, Head TutorProfessor Stephen Mitchell, Chair\u000a	Folklore and Mythology is a liberal education in and of itself. The program encourages the study of any given society through its language and culture, offering an array of choices for drawing on a variety of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. To focus on the folklore and mythology of a society (at local, regional as well as national levels) is to understand how that group or society defines itself through epics, music, folktales, legends, dramas, dance, rituals, \u201cbeliefs,\u201d proverbs, customs, law codes, festival celebrations, \u201cwisdom literature,\u201d and many other forms of expressive culture. To study the folklore and mythology of any group is to discover how that group identifies itself in relation to others. Concentrators conduct independent research on the material, oral, written, or performed forms of folklore and mythology in a variety of cultures, among them African, North and South American, Celtic, Chinese, English, German, Greek, Indian, Japanese, Scandinavian, and Slavic.\u000a	The purpose of the basic courses outlined below is to provide concentrators with a general knowledge of the materials of folklore and mythology, its genres and divisions, and the various kinds of intellectual approaches to the materials that have been, and still are, used to understand and interpret them. The course on fieldwork and ethnography continues this purpose of providing general background by critiquing and applying various anthropological methods of interpreting cultural expressions. In these basic courses and early tutorials, materials from many cultures are used.\u000a	The special fields are designed to assure that the concentrator has an in-depth knowledge of folklore and mythology in one given area. There is considerable variation in the special fields administered by the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology, and the specific requirements vary from field to field. They can be roughly divided between those that are language and literature based and those that are not, such as music or social anthropology. Sample programs for the several special fields are available through the Head Tutor\u2019s office, but each student should work out the details of the student's own Plan of Study with the Head Tutor or the committee member or members representing the particular special fields.\u000a	The tutorials in the second half of the junior year and throughout the senior year are in the special field, the senior tutorials being either devoted largely to developing a senior thesis, or to a senior project. During the senior year, we expect students concentrating in Folklore &amp; Mythology to demonstrate their command of cultural theory and analysis. In the senior project option, Folklore and Mythology 96r, such competence may be demonstrated through, for example, a performance, exhibit, or written analysis, usually in connection with specific Folklore and Mythology courses (or related courses approved by the Head Tutor). Students who wish to be considered for high honors or highest honors write a Senior Honors Thesis, an extended research project carried out over two semesters as Folklore and Mythology 99, under the supervision of a faculty adviser.\u000a	Students interested in concentrating in Folklore and Mythology should make an appointment with the Head Tutor or Assistant Head Tutor to discuss the concentration and special field interests. Joint concentrations with other fields are possible and students should discuss their interests of combining fields with the Head Tutors or Directors of Undergraduate Studies of both Folklore and Mythology and the allied program to discuss options.\u000aREQUIREMENTS14 courses (56 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Students planning to concentrate in Folklore and Mythology should consult with the Head Tutor and a faculty member in the student\u2019s prospective special field, normally a member or affiliated member, of the committee. Concentrators are required to see the Head Tutor at the beginning of each term about selection of courses and tutorials, preparation for the senior thesis or senior project and general examination, and for his signature on study cards.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Folklore and Mythology, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	The Milman Parry Collection of Oral Literature is one of the largest and best of its kind in the world.

aV\u000aDr. Lisa Laskin, Director of Studies\u000a	The option of petitioning for a Special Concentration was established by the Faculty in 1971 for the serious student whose academic interests cross departmental lines. Special Concentrations offers students the opportunity to design their own program of concentration with the advice and consent of the various members of the faculty and administration. With this option the Faculty addressed special educational objectives not accommodated by existing concentrations. Special Concentrations is not intended to encourage students either to avoid particular departmental requirements or to create a broad, unfocused concentration that could be described as "general studies."\u000a	The Standing Committee on Special Concentrations, which is composed of faculty from a wide range of disciplines, sets the general policies and educational guidelines for the program, and considers individually each petition submitted. The detailed administration of each student\u2019s program is supervised by the student's faculty adviser and by the Director of Studies.\u000a	Although most special concentration proposals include a full tutorial program culminating in a senior thesis for honors candidates, Special Concentrations is also open to students who prefer a basic course of study. Basic concentrators submit a 14 course program (56 credits); 16 courses (64 credits) are required of honors candidates. To the extent that there are similar requirements in the existing concentrations most closely related to the proposed special concentration, an honors-eligible Plan of Study must ordinarily include provision for tutorial in both the junior and senior years, and completion and evaluation of a senior thesis or equivalent. A written or oral general examination, administered by the faculty adviser plus one other faculty member, is required.\u000a	Seniors completing the basic program are expected to enroll in Special Concentrations 96r during their final term. This course focuses on the production of a substantial piece of writing or special project related to issues or themes of the student\u2019s Special Concentration. The form of the composition is not prescribed and can range from an interpretative essay, to a critical review of the bibliography in the field, to a research paper on a particular topic. The Director of Studies and faculty adviser must approve the project.\u000a	There are no a priori minimum grade averages that an applicant must achieve to qualify for Special Concentrations or to obtain approval of a Plan of Study. It is necessary, however, that the standing committee be convinced not only of the quality, rigor, and legitimacy of the topic, but also of the applicant\u2019s high level of self-motivation, perseverance, and conscientiousness, since the success of each Special Concentration depends on the drive and determination of the student more than in a regular departmental concentration. From time to time the committee has rejected applications for concentrations that were unquestionably valid areas of academic inquiry but could not be accommodated within existing resources of the University.\u000a	The process of development from interest and idea to a detailed and approved special concentration may seem long and complicated, but most students have found it constructive and illuminating. Seeking out a faculty adviser and tutors provides the occasion to meet and talk with a number of faculty members, and not infrequently it turns out that a student discovers that the special plan can be accommodated within an existing department. In other cases, it is clear that Special Concentrations is an appropriate vehicle to assist a student to pursue in depth some interdisciplinary interest. The role of the faculty adviser in special concentrations is crucial. The principal faculty adviser must ordinarily be a member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and must agree to supervise and oversee the student\u2019s entire program of concentration from the development of the initial course structure through any necessary revisions of the Plan of Study to the general examination required of all senior concentrators.\u000a	Each approved Special Concentration exists as a small committee within our program. Plans of Study for the individual concentrations are unique, but all are interdisciplinary. For example, several current programs deal with health and public policy, combining coursework from history and science, economics, sociology, and government. A burgeoning interest in urban studies lately has produced several Special Concentrations, some emphasizing city planning, others leaning toward government or economics.\u000a	Special Concentrations represents a small but significant portion of undergraduate concentrators. It seems best for those students who have not only an unusual interest, but who also have a clear grasp of the direction in which they are heading. Although there are exceptions, most successful Special Concentrations applications have been submitted by upperclassmen who have spent one or two terms studying in one of the College\u2019s established concentrations.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 16 courses (64 credits)\u000aADVISING\u000a	Because of the nature of this program, advising is highly personalized. Students ordinarily have frequent meetings with their faculty adviser during the academic year and discuss their programs with the Director of Studies at least once at the beginning of each term. The Director of Studies also offers guidance to students interested in preparing a Special Concentration proposal for review by our faculty committee.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Special Concentrations, please see the Special Concentrations website: https://specialconcentrations.fas.harvard.edu/.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	Although in one sense students in Special Concentrations have no particular resources reserved for them such as special libraries or laboratories, in another and very real sense all the resources of the University are available for the support of special concentrators in completing their programs. Since faculty advisers and tutors in Special Concentrations come from many different Harvard faculties, it is frequently the case that special concentrators in Public Health have the facilities of that school open to them as those in Urban Studies have the facilities of the Graduate School of Design or the Kennedy School.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	All inquiries should be addressed to the Director of Studies at specialconc@fas.harvard.edu.\u000a	Once each term, Special Concentrations hosts an information session for prospective students.

aV\u000aDr. Lisa Parkes, Director of Undergraduate Studies, GermanDr. Agnes Broomé, Director of Undergraduate Studies, Scandinavian\u000a	The Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures offers a rich and diverse program of literary and cultural studies, including film and music. We offer students the option to pursue a concentration in German Studies, Scandinavian Studies, or a joint concentration in German and another field. Our goal is to provide students with the enriching experience of studying languages, literatures, and cultures different from their own so they can gain new perspectives on their languages and countries of origin. At the same time, students will learn how the German-speaking and Nordic countries have influenced the development of Western culture and society. Our graduates are well positioned to understand the central role played by modern Germany in international politics and economics. They can explain why Germany takes the positions it does, the role of the European Union, and why international organizations call on distinguished members of the Scandinavian countries to represent them on taskforces involving matters of conscience. We aim above all to equip students with proficient language, analytical and critical skills for academic, professional, or personal use, as well as an understanding of the politics, culture, history, and ideas through literature, film, music, and other media. Thus, the program is designed not only for students who wish to pursue graduate study in Germanic studies, but also for students who choose careers in education, medicine, law, government, the social sciences, scientific research, business, the arts, design, and other fields.\u000a	Our department has a highly favorable ratio of full-time faculty to concentrators, which enables the faculty to provide students with individual guidance and support. Much of the tutorial work is done by full-time faculty, and all seniors writing a thesis have the opportunity to work individually with a professor. The department actively supports both work and study abroad, and all concentration options are designed to accommodate them.\u000a	There are no prerequisites for the concentration; however, students should first develop their language skills to meet the required level of proficiency. German language is offered from beginning to advanced levels; students with prior knowledge of German should take a placement test. Students may begin to study the German language with German 10 (elementary German) or with German 10ab (intensive elementary). Most concentrators in German take the sequence of German 20 (second year) and at least one 60-level course (third year) in order to prepare them for the 100-level courses. The introductory survey courses, German 101 and 102, count as the sophomore tutorial in German, though students are permitted to postpone this sequence until their junior year. Students interested in the Scandinavian concentration (or a Scandinavian language citation) are likewise urged to begin their language study as soon as possible. Students with prior knowledge of a Scandinavian language should contact Dr. Broomé for placement. Our program offers Swedish courses through the second-year level, from Swedish 10 (Beginning Swedish Language and Literature) to Swedish 20 (Special Topics in Swedish Literature and Culture), as well as Old Norse (Scandinavian 160a and 160br). Scandinavian 91r (Independent Study) is available for advanced language students. Danish, Finnish, modern Icelandic, and Norwegian are available as language tutorial courses (Scandinavian 90r.a-c). Students interested in these languages should contact Dr. Broomé at their earliest opportunity, preferably prior to the start of the academic term when they wish to begin their language study.\u000a	Concentrators desiring to be considered for honors write a senior thesis of 40 to 50 pages. The thesis is designed to demonstrate that a candidate can read and interpret a literary text or a complex cultural or social phenomenon with authority, insight, and originality, and that s/he is familiar with the major critical writings on the subject. All seniors are required to pass a one-hour oral or a three-hour written examination. The questions for this examination, designed to give students the opportunity to synthesize the knowledge they have gained from their studies, are based on individual reading lists submitted by each senior to a faculty committee. In addition, all graduating seniors are required to take a final language assessment in all four skills: speaking, listening, writing, and reading. The department offers an AB/AM degree option for Advanced Standing students. Information can be found on the department\u2019s website; students interested in this option are encouraged to consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies by the fall term of their third year.\u000aOPTIONS:\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements for All Options\u000aGerman StudiesSpecific Requirements\u000a					An additional three courses either in German or in related fields with sufficient focus on the German aspect of the field.

aV\u000aProfessor Joseph Blitzstein, Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aProfessor Michael Parzen, Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aProfessor Kevin Rader, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Statistics is a relatively young discipline, organized around the rapidly growing body of knowledge about principled methods for data collection and data analysis, the making of rational decisions under uncertainty, and the modeling of randomness in any quantitative inquiries, including the social, natural, and medical sciences. Statistics has a theoretical core surrounded by a large number of domains of application in fields such as anthropology, astronomy, biology, business, chemistry, computer science, economics, education, engineering, environmental sciences, epidemiology, finance, forensic science, geophysical sciences, government, history, law, linguistics, mathematics, medicine, physics, population science, psychology, sociology, and many others. A basic goal of the concentration in Statistics is to help students acquire the conceptual, computational, and mathematical tools for quantifying uncertainty and making sense of complex data arising from many applications - including statistically sound ways of collecting such data. The mathematical preparation required includes multivariable calculus and linear algebra to the level of Mathematics 19A and 19B (or preferably Mathematics 21A and 21B, or above). The computational preparation required includes Computer Science 50, or above.\u000a	A basic introduction to the field is provided by any of Statistics 100 through 104, which introduce statistical principles (without any mathematical or statistical prerequisite), with different areas of application emphasized as indicated in the descriptions. Statistics 100 through 104 fulfill the Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning requirement for General Education. A theoretical introduction is provided by Statistics 110: Introduction to Probability together with Statistics 111: Introduction to Theoretical Statistics. These courses provide grounding in traditional and modern approaches to statistical modeling and inference. They are prerequisites for most of the department\u2019s more advanced courses, which study specific methods, models, and applications.\u000a	The Statistics concentration is a flexible program that permits as many as half of the 14 courses required for honors eligibility to be taken in departments other than Statistics. Because Statistics offers an opportunity to branch out and explore a variety of areas it appeals to students who wish to acquire core skills while preserving their chance for a broad general education. It also appeals to those with strong mathematical interests who enjoy seeing formal argument bear direct fruit in practical use.\u000aA concentration in Statistics prepares a student for many careers in industry (in technology companies, finance, and elsewhere) and government, for graduate study in a very broad collection of engineering, social and natural sciences, and for professional study in law, medicine, business, or public administration. The demand for people with statistical training is rising in most areas.\u000a	The Statistics concentration requirements can be fulfilled via any of four tracks: a general track in core statistical principles and methods, a track in Data Science, a track in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB), and a track in Quantitative Finance. These tracks all lead to a degree in Statistics. The Data Science, BCB, and Quantitative Finance tracks provide interdisciplinary education combining statistics with computer science, biology, and finance, respectively. The general track is the most flexible track, and provides a foundation for statistical theory, methods, and applications.\u000a	The Data Science track, newly introduced in 2016, explores the interface of statistics, computer science, and application areas, emphasizing topics such as prediction, machine learning, and analysis of massive data sets. By placing the generation and analysis of data at the center of modern analytics, data science is having a major impact in a vast array of areas, including business, government and politics, science and engineering, medicine and public health, journalism, sports, law, and education. The requirements for the Data Science Track are described in detail below.\u000aThe Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Track in Statistics is aimed at undergraduates with interest in quantitative methods and modeling applied to data from the biological, medical, and life sciences. The recent explosion of size and complexity of data in the biological and life sciences, such as the human/animal/plants genome projects with gene and protein sequences, has motivated the development of new statistical methodologies and models, such as models for gene and protein motifs search, phylogenetic reconstruction, and gene expression analysis. Core requirements in statistics emphasize statistical modeling, especially as it relates to biological systems. Additional courses in biology allow students to obtain a strong foundation in molecular and cellular biology, evolutionary biology, or ecology. The requirements for the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Track are described in detail below.\u000a	The Quantitative Finance Track in Statistics is designed as a specialization for concentrators in Statistics with special interest in quantitative issues that arise in financial and insurance modeling. The focus is on the stochastic analysis that is relevant in these fields. The specific topics addressed include statistical inference of stochastic models that arise in financial/insurance modeling, computational techniques that have become standard in pricing, risk assessment of complex financial/insurance instruments, and analysis and predication for time series. The requirements for the Quantitative Finance Track are described in detail below.\u000a	The Department of Statistics also offers a secondary field. With its strong methodological and applications focus, Statistics has consequently attracted students with a primary focus in another discipline, such as psychology, economics, sociology, government, earth and planetary sciences, and biology (both OEB and MCB). The secondary field in Statistics will provide students with a solid background in statistics that they can apply in their primary field or fields of interest. For more information on the secondary field in Statistics, please see the secondary fields section of this website.\u000a	See http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/pages/undergraduate-statistics-general-information for more information about the Statistics concentration.\u000aREQUIREMENTS Basic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aRequirements for Joint ConcentrationsStudents interested in a joint concentration should consult the Directors of Undergraduate Studies in both concentrations at an early date.\u000aADVISING\u000a	The Co-Directors of Undergraduate Studies are advisers to all Statistics concentrators. It is expected that students will discuss their program and review their progress with one of the Co-Directors at the beginning of each term.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Statistics, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000aFor more information, please consult with the Student Programs Administrator, Kathleen Cloutier, Science Center 400E (617-496-1402, cloutier@fas.harvard.edu) and the Co-Directors of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Joseph Blitzstein, Science Center 714 (617-496-2985, blitzstein@stat.harvard.edu) and Professor Michael Parzen, Science Center 300B (617-495-8711, mparzen@stat.harvard.edu) or the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Kevin Rader, Science Center 614 (617-495-5204, krader@fas.harvard.edu), and read through the concentration webpage at http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/pages/undergraduate-statistics-general-information.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December

aV\u000aProfessor Cheryl Welch, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aThe concentration in Government introduces students to the discipline of political science: the study of power in all of its many forms and consequences. Aiming both to prepare students to lead engaged civic lives and to introduce them to the ways in which political scientists explain and analyze the social and political world around us, the concentration has four curricular goals:\u000aOur first goal is to make all students aware and critical of their unexamined assumptions about politics. Learning to think independently and with some critical distance, to analyze arguments\u2014theoretical, empirical and rhetorical\u2014to weigh alternatives, to write cogently, and to speak persuasively are essential skills for responsible global citizenship as well as professional careers. Government 97 (sophomore tutorial) begins the process by asking students to consider several urgent issues that face us today through the critical lens of political science. For example, how do political scientists think about the ethical, empirical, and conceptual dimensions of growing economic inequality in advanced democracies? Or about the threats associated with climate change? After engaging with such important discussions of real-world issues, students in Gov 97 then try their own hands at independent research and analysis.\u000aTo achieve breadth in the discipline of political science is our second aim. Political science covers many different subjects, including the philosophy and ethics of exercising power and the history of political ideas (political theory); the operation of politics in the United States (American politics); the diversity of political regimes, institutions, and behaviors in the contemporary world and the significance of these divergences (comparative politics); and, finally, the interaction among international actors, the causes of war and peace, and the roots of global poverty and prosperity (international relations). Political scientists work in and across these disciplinary subfields using a large and varied tool kit: qualitative methods such as historical and archival research, fieldwork, interviews, and textual analysis; and various quantitative approaches including statistical analysis, formal modeling and experiments. Our goal is to assure that concentrators grasp the main approaches and topics in the discipline by introducing the breadth of political science in Government 97 (sophomore tutorial), by requiring Gov 50 (a basic literacy course in approaches to political science research), and by requiring concentrators to take at least one course in each of the traditional subfields described above.\u000aThird, we encourage students to chart a distinctive path through political science. We offer each student the possibility of satisfying his or her particular intellectual bent and curiosity through a cluster of electives and at least one required seminar. Each student has the freedom to choose his or her particular path through the diverse Government curriculum, but we want to assure that choices are thoughtful and informed. Therefore students begin to work on a particular plan to navigate the rich resources in the department in sophomore spring in consultation with their sophomore tutor and concentration adviser. During the next four semesters students refine this plan with the help of advisers and faculty. Often students cluster electives either in a subfield, a geographical area, or a particular methodological approach, and enroll in a seminar that allows them to think about framing a research question using their chosen focus.\u000aFinally, we encourage students to produce as well as consume political science research. All concentrators are required to take at least one seminar, in which they produce a research paper or other project under the guidance of teaching faculty. They are also welcome to fulfill one elective requirement through Gov 92r: Faculty Research Assistantship for Credit and/or through one or more of our research practice courses: Government 61 (Research Practice in Quantitative Methods), Government 62 (Research Practice in Qualitative Methods), or Government 63 (Topics and Resources in Political Theory). Those who choose the honors track (which requires a thesis) are normally expected to take one of the research practice courses. Honors concentrators often use multiple seminars to explore possible research directions for the senior thesis, a substantial work of independent scholarship that serves as the capstone of their experience in Government.\u000aGovernment as a Secondary Field\u000aMany students pursue a secondary field in Government, which requires five courses, with no more than two at the foundational level (e.g., Gov 10, 20, 30 or 40). For examples of  how students have used secondary fields in government, please consult the Secondary Field page on our website.\u000aGovernment as Part of a Joint Concentration\u000aGovernment offers a few students the possibility of a joint concentration, with Government as either the primary or allied concentration. Petitions for joint concentrations are entertained twice a year: once in September and once in February. For more about this option, see the Joint Concentration page on our website, and note the special requirements for joint concentrators listed below.\u000aREQUIREMENTSFor students in the class of 2015 and beyond.Other students should refer to the Fields of Concentration from the year in which they declared their concentration.\u000aBasic Requirements: 10 courses (40 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aJoint ConcentrationGovernment as the Primary Field: 17 courses (68 credits) total(11 courses in Government\u201444 credits)\u000aGovernment as the Allied Field: 6 courses (24 credits) in Government\u000aSTUDY ABROAD\u000a	The Government department encourages study abroad for a term, and it is also possible to study abroad for an entire academic year. The Government department is very flexible in granting credit towards the concentration requirements for political science courses taken elsewhere although all such courses must be discussed with, and approved by, the DUS. Ordinarily, a student can count two courses taken abroad in any one semester towards Gov concentration requirements. Students must receive a grade of B\u2013 (or equivalent) or higher in order to receive final approval for courses taken abroad.\u000aSUMMER SCHOOL\u000a	Generally, students can count only one Harvard Summer School Government course, taught either on campus or abroad, towards their Government concentration requirements. If that course is not taught by a Harvard Government Department faculty member, the student must petition the Government DUS before the course is taken.\u000aADVISING\u000a	For information and advice about the Government concentration, students are encouraged to meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and with the concentration advisers in the Houses. Please consult the department\u2019s website for a listing of advisers and office hours.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	For further information concerning concentration in Government, students should visit the Government Undergraduate Program Office (617-495-3249). The office, located at CGIS Knafel Building, room K151, 1737 Cambridge Street, is open Monday through Friday, 9:30\u20135:30.

aV\u000aTBD, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	Theater, Dance, and Media (TDM) combines historical and theoretical study with creative art making. Taught by FAS Faculty, experienced professionals from the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and the Harvard Dance Center, as well as numerous visiting artists/scholars each year, students are introduced to the rigor and discipline required to master the interlocking fields out of which theater, dance and media practices are composed.  The goal of the concentration is to combine rigorous conservatory-style training with a cognitive approach to art making. Students are encouraged to range broadly across all art forms, including literature, music, and the visual arts, all so important to the performing arts.\u000a	The concentration emphasizes collaboration. Actors, producers, directors, choreographers, dancers, writers, designers, and stage managers necessarily work together to create and produce a successful performance. Many of our studio courses model this kind of collaboration; they also include reading or other analytical components to enhance the studio work.  Similarly, scholarly courses are often reinforced with practical application of studio skills in the classroom.\u000a	In addition to the required coursework, students pursuing the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration will have the opportunity to participate in at least two TDM concentration production studio courses led by professional directors, choreographers, and designers. Concentrators will also obtain valuable technical skills through both working on the crew for at least one concentration show, as well as through studio design classes and the concentration technical and production training modules.\u000aREQUIREMENTS\u000aElective Program: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aRequirements for Joint-Concentration: Consult Director of Undergraduate Studies and see TDM website for further information. http://tdm.fas.harvard.edu.\u000aADVISING\u000a	The Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) advises all students when they enter the concentration, eventually assigning to them additional faculty and professional advisors, based on the students\u2019 particular interests and their work in or on specific productions.  Together with the DUS, these advisors will support students in developing a coherent course of study and a solid body of artistic work that is suited to each student\u2019s goals and interests.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	For more information about the concentration, please visit the department website.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December\u000aTheater, Dance, and Media was a new concentration in 2015-16.

aV\u000aProfessor Lisa McGirr,  Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000aWhat is History, and how do we view the world?\u000a	Our goal in History is to foster both critical and research skills in our students, a combination that will enhance their entire Harvard experience and serve them far beyond their college years. To achieve this, the History concentration combines rigor with flexibility, facilitates close student engagement with our diverse faculty, and solicits regular student input. Finally, the History Department faculty teach courses that seek to unsettle students - encouraging them to confront unfamiliar ideas, cultures, and eras - and to question their own assumptions about the world and their place in it.\u000aWhat is it like to study History at Harvard?\u000a	Students of history are always studying something else beyond history. Historians study politics and government; diplomacy and international relations; science and technology; finance and economics; religion and philosophy; literature and arts; cultural and social changes and exchanges; archaeology, anthropology, evolutionary psychology, and genetics. Interdisciplinarity is native to historical practice. Our students familiarize themselves with the methods and theoretical assumptions of other disciplines, even while learning how these methods and theories are just as much products of history as the questions they were developed to address. History makes all your interests more interesting.\u000aWhat is the value of studying History?\u000a	History students examine issues critically and creatively, grasp details while seeing the big picture, and think boldly but flexibly enough to change their opinions when change is warranted. These are the skills of a sophisticated thinker and a responsible citizen. They are also valued in countless fields. Graduates move on to law school, business school, academic careers in various fields, teaching, journalism, government, and non-profit work. Students wind up in exciting places during college as well, through summer jobs, internships, academic programs, service initiatives, and terms or school years abroad.\u000aWhat are the goals of the History concentration?\u000a	History students study how societies and people functioned in various contexts in the past and how the past continues to shape the present. Our faculty help students learn how to analyze complex events and craft original arguments from large amounts of disparate evidence. This capacity for research is one of the central goals of the concentration, and it creates skills that carry over into a wide array of postgraduate opportunities, especially those that value the ability to process complicated sets of information, to take multiple perspectives on that information, and to communicate effectively and concisely about it. Students are encouraged to follow their own interests while the department provides structured guidance and rigorous training in research skills, critical reading, oral communication, effective writing, and problem solving.  The discipline enables students to engage with the unfamiliar with confidence and creativity.\u000aDo I have to write a thesis?\u000a	History has two tracks, basic and honors. They differ only in that the honors track requires a thesis as well as enrollment in History 99, our year-long Thesis Seminar. Our advising programs support students who begin preliminary thesis work as early as junior year, and numerous college fellowships provide funding for summertime research. The thesis program itself is flexible enough that students can decide as late as shopping week senior fall whether to write a thesis. Meanwhile, the requirement to produce a substantial research paper in one of your History seminars ensures that either way, you will produce an original work of historical scholarship that can be the capstone to your undergraduate academic career.\u000aAre there other options instead of a full concentration?\u000a	Our robust secondary field requires five courses, including one seminar. Our faculty are well represented in the Gen Ed course offerings and in interdisciplinary courses with a variety of disciplines. Hundreds of non-concentrators every semester take classes from History faculty, gaining an introduction to the critical and creative skills historians emphasize. No matter what interests you, History has something to offer\u2014everything has a history, and our Department teaches you how to recover, recreate, interpret, and use it.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Program: 10 courses (40 credits)Thesis Program: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aJoint Concentrations in East Asian, Near Eastern, and Ancient (Greek and Roman) History\u000aStudents whose interest in African and African American Studies, Anthropology, East Asian, Near Eastern, or Ancient (Greek and Roman) civilizations is primarily historical in character should consider the relevant joint concentration which has been pre-approved in each of these areas. The goal of each program is to introduce students to the craft of historical study - the ways historians make sense of the past, and the skills of historical analysis, writing, and research - as well as to promote a critical understanding of the historical experience of African/African American/East Asian/Near Eastern/Greek and Roman societies, or to join together the fields of historical and anthropological study (archeological or social).\u000aJoint concentrations with certain other fields are possible, but are designed on a case-by-case basis in consultation with both departments.\u000aStudents pursuing one of the pre-approved joint concentrations will complete one-half of their tutorial work in the History Department (History 97) and the other half in African and African American Studies, Anthropology, East Asian Studies, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, or the Classics. Students take a History seminar, typically in junior year,  in which they write a 20-page research paper based on primary sources; in addition they take a seminar or junior tutorial in the joint field as specified in each case. In the senior year, joint concentrators write an honors thesis, an original work of research which is advised and evaluated in both concentations and which typically focuses on some aspect of African, African American, East Asian, Near Eastern, or Ancient Greek and Roman history, or is located at the intersection of history and anthropology (archaeological or social)..\u000aAll joint concentrators are required to take 14 courses, including the senior thesis tutorial in History or the joint field.\u000aConcentration requirements for the Joint Concentration in History and African and African American Studies (African Studies track): 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aConcentration requirements for the Joint Concentration in History and African and African American Studies (African American Studies track): 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aPlease also note the following information:\u000aTwo types of courses count automatically toward AAAS/History concentration requirements:\u000aThe joint concentration also regularly accepts credit from Study Abroad toward concentration requirements.

aV\u000aProfessor Ruth Lingford, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The concentration in Visual and Environmental Studies cultivates skills in both the practice and the critical study of the visual arts. Its components include photography, filmmaking, animation, video art, painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture, as well as film and visual studies, critical theory, and the study of the built environment. The department has a strong commitment to fostering dialogue among makers, critics, and theorists. The modes of teaching combine the intensity of conservatory programs with the broad intellectual aims of a liberal arts college.\u000a	Within VES, there are three different areas of focus\u20141) studio arts, 2) film/video making, and 3) film and visual studies\u2014and each have slightly different requirements. In studio arts and film/video, concentrators work toward comprehensive accomplishment in a chosen area of artistic production while simultaneously exploring a variety of other practices. In film and visual studies, concentrators pursue interdisciplinary approaches to the theory and history of images, space, art, and media. In all areas, VES concentrators work closely with faculty, predominantly in studios and small seminars, to gain understanding through both study and practice.\u000a	Upon graduation, concentrators in VES enter a wide variety of fields. Some pursue careers as artists or filmmakers while others go into media and communications. Among the graduate schools to which VES concentrators are admitted are schools of architecture, animation, art, film, and photography, as well graduate schools of arts and sciences, medicine, and business.\u000aREQUIREMENTS12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequired courses (vary by track):\u000aSTUDIO ARTS AND FILM/VIDEO\u000aFILM and VISUAL STUDIES\u000aINFORMATION FOR ALL TRACKS\u000aADVISING\u000a	Departmental academic advising is provided by the Director of Undergraduate Studies who meets individually with concentrators to discuss course selection. Information and advice is also available throughout the year in the Carpenter Center from Paula Soares, Manager of Academic Programs, who is available on a walk-in basis during most regular office hours. Each new concentrator is assigned a faculty adviser and is required to meet with the adviser at least once at the start of each term to review the Plan of Study. Students are reminded that they are each ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of concentration requirements, and should check regularly on the current status of their progress.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Visual and Environmental Studies, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	Aside from providing the space in which the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies holds many of its classes, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, designed by world-renowned architect Le Corbusier, is an important landmark in the recent history of architecture and is the setting in which Harvard evidences its concern for contemporary expression in the visual arts. During the academic year exhibitions, performances, events, film screenings, and lectures are offered. In addition, the Harvard Film Archive, housed in the Carpenter Center, mounts an ongoing program of film screenings.\u000a	The Carpenter Center contains studio classrooms for the practice of the studio arts. The department also holds classes in Sever Hall, where most of the film, video, and animation studio courses are conducted. Studios at 6\u20138 Linden Street are used by practicing artists and photographers, including members of the faculty and senior concentrators doing thesis work, when applicable.\u000a	Visual and Environmental Studies concentrators benefit from the unusually rich University collections of Harvard\u2019s museums: The Harvard Art Museum, Natural History, Semitic, and Peabody museums containing Western, Asian, and ethnographic art. Harvard\u2019s library holdings in art and archaeology include more than 250,000 books and more than 1,500,000 photographs and slides.\u000a	The Museum of Fine Arts is one of Boston\u2019s great cultural resources. Other resources are the ICA Boston, the MIT List Visual Arts Center, and the commercial and non-profit galleries of the greater Boston area.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Further information about the concentration may be obtained from the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Ruth Lingford (Lingford@fas.harvard.edu) or the Manager of Academic Programs, Paula Soares (soares@fas.harvard.edu, 617-496-4469).

aV\u000aDr. Lauren Kaminsky, Director of Studies\u000a	History and Literature is the oldest concentration at Harvard, and for many years it was the only concentration. Conceived as an antidote to President Eliot\u2019s "elective system," it served as a model for the reconstruction of undergraduate education under President Lowell, one of the founders of History and Literature.Individual and small group tutorials are the heart of History and Literature. They provide individual instruction and mentoring, opportunities to pursue specific topics in depth, and a general framework within which the many elements of a student\u2019s plan of concentration may be integrated. Concentrators take concentration courses across a variety of departments and programs: Romance Languages and Literatures; African and African American Studies; Visual and Environmental Studies; History of Art and Architecture; Theater, Dance and Media; Music; Women, Gender, and Sexuality; as well as History, English, and many more.Students take a History and Literature tutorial each semester they are in the concentration. Sophomore tutorial\u2014taught in the sophomore spring by two instructors from different disciplines\u2014introduces students to interdisciplinary methods and explores topics in depth. In the fall semester of junior tutorial, groups of three students collaboratively design a course of study with the guidance of an instructor. In the junior spring, students focus on researching and writing their junior essays. The senior tutorial is one-on-one instruction primarily devoted to researching and writing the thesis.Written work is an important part of both sophomore and junior tutorial, building to the thesis in the senior year. Students are encouraged to spend their first two years at Harvard exploring various disciplines and subjects of interest before working closely with concentration advisers to select a field of study at the end of the sophomore year. In the junior and senior years, the fields of study provide a structure to ensure that concentrators gain knowledge that is broad as well as deep. History and Literature thus aspires to promote the integration of disciplines and a balance between general knowledge and specific expertise. It is a demanding and immensely rewarding enterprise.History and Literature encourages concentrators to grow as writers and researchers, and the concentration is designed to teach students to think in interdisciplinary ways.  Students develop skills in close reading, identifying and analyzing primary and secondary sources, posing research questions, conducting original research, using evidence, making arguments, and in communicating clearly and persuasively. History and Literature trains students in the theories and methodologies of historical and literary scholarship so that they may make original contributions with the senior thesis.Concentrators are encouraged to consider study abroad as a means for augmenting their work in the concentration. Advisers in the concentration work closely with students who elect to study abroad to help craft plans of study that integrate courses taken out-of-residence.History and Literature requires students to apply before declaring the concentration. Upon submitting an application, students will be asked to schedule an advising meeting. This is the first of many advising conversations that form the backbone of the concentration. Students interested in exploring History and Literature are invited to enroll in a History and Literature 90 seminar, open to non-concentrators, in the freshman or sophomore year.History and Literature welcomes joint concentrations and secondary fields, and it aspires to make the integration of two concentrations as seamless as possible. History and Literature must be the primary concentration in any joint plan of study, except when the student plans to pursue a creative senior project. In that case, the department providing artistic training may be the primary concentration. Please see the Director of Studies with any questions about joint concentrations.\u000aREQUIREMENTS14 courses (56 credits)\u000a	At the end of sophomore year, each History and Literature concentrator selects a field of study and submits a Field Worksheet. Revised worksheets are submitted in the junior and senior years. A regularly-updated list of the courses that count in the various fields is available on the History and Literature website. Courses in the social sciences on subjects related to the student's field may be accepted for concentration credit by the Committee on Instruction on an individual basis.\u000aADVISING\u000a	Each student is assigned to a tutor who also functions as that student\u2019s academic adviser. The adviser and student work closely together to assemble a Plan of Concentration that fits the student\u2019s intellectual interests and fulfills concentration requirements. History and Literature\u2019s personalized academic advising gives students a flexible, individualized educational experience.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	Students are invited to visit History and Literature in Barker 122 and online at http://histlit.fas.harvard.edu.

aV\u000aDr. Caroline Light, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The study of gender and sexuality has long constituted a vibrant and engaging arena for interdisciplinary work and intellectual inquiry. At the heart of this field is the assertion that gender and sexuality are fundamental categories of social organization and power that are inseparable from race, ethnicity, class, nationality, and other categories of difference.\u000a	The concentration in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality (WGS) brings together a wide range of academic fields in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences (including history, literature, visual studies, anthropology, sociology, ethnic studies, political science, psychology, and biology, to name just a few). As an interdisciplinary field of study, WGS pays close attention to how social norms have changed over time and how they vary across cultures. The concentration also actively investigates the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality have shaped public policy, civil rights, health care, religion, education and the law, as well as the depiction of women and men in art, literature, and the popular media. WGS courses are characterized by a strong commitment to critical thinking, as well as a spirit of open and sustained intellectual inquiry.\u000a	WGS prides itself on the intense intellectual engagement of its students and its close collaboration between students and faculty. Beginning with the small-group sophomore tutorial (WGS 97), WGS provides students with a rigorous grounding in the theory and methodology of gender and sexuality studies, helping students hone their skills in critical analysis, close reading, and effective research and writing. All full concentrators must enroll in the two foundation courses numbered WGS 1200 (historical approaches) and WGS 1210 (theories of gender and sexuality), and two WGS or WGS-related 1400+ level seminars. Joint concentrators may choose one of the foundation courses. Concentrators may also fulfill concentration requirements by taking courses on WGS-related topics in other programs and departments. (A list of pre-approved courses from other departments is available on the WGS website.) Students will work with concentration advisers to develop cohesive plans of study that are primarily situated within the humanities, social sciences, or natural sciences.\u000aRequirements: 12 courses (48 credits), including WGS 97(Sophomore Tutorial), WGS 1200 (historical approaches), and WGS1210 (theories of gender and sexuality), seven electives, and two WGS courses at the 1400+ level. Students may opt to take an approved \u201cengaged scholarship\u201d course in place of one of the 1400+ level courses.\u000aThesis Track: 13 courses (52 credits). Students interested in pursuing honors recognition will apply to enter the thesis track during the first semester of junior year. The director and assistant director of undergraduate studies will review applicants' previous academic records and may also elect to interview students before admission to the thesis track. In the spring, students selected for the thesis track will enroll in WGS 98r (Junior Tutorial - Research and Methods), a semester-long seminar designed to help them understand the craft of WGS research and writing. Students meet weekly in seminar to investigate research methods in the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Students also meet individually with graduate tutors to develop their own research projects. Over the course of the semester, students identify a research topic, create a proposal, and research and write a 20-to-25-page paper.\u000a	During senior year, thesis track students enroll in WGS 99a/b, where they design, research, and write senior theses. Thesis track students work individually with a thesis adviser and participate in a group senior tutorial. In keeping with the interdisciplinary character of WGS, senior theses may draw upon a wide range of approaches, including literary analysis, ethnography, scientific investigation, archival research, visual analysis, and cultural or political critique. Honors-eligible students also take an oral examination.\u000aJoint Concentrations: A joint concentration is an excellent choice for honors-eligible students who want to integrate their studies in WGS with deeper exploration of another field, building toward a final integrated thesis project. Students can pursue a joint concentration with WGS and a range of other concentrations including African and African American Studies, Anthropology, English, History and Literature, History and Science, Literature, Music, Philosophy, Religion, Romance Languages, Social Studies, Sociology, Statistics, and Visual and Environmental Studies. Since course requirements vary among the individual programs, students planning to concentrate jointly are responsible for meeting with advisers in both concentrations to obtain specific guidelines.\u000aSecondary Fields: Students take one foundation course (either WGS 1200 or WGS 1210), which grounds them in the history or theory of gender and sexuality studies. The flexibility of the remaining four course requirements allows students to sample the rich course offerings in WGS while developing core areas of interest.\u000a	We advise interested first-year students and sophomores to take a WGS course at the 1100 or 1200 level, a Freshman Seminar on WGS issues, or one of the General Education courses offered by WGS faculty. Students interested in WGS as a concentration or a secondary field should meet with either the director or assistant director of undergraduate studies.\u000a	Further information is available on the WGS website, including a list of courses outside WGS that count for concentration credit. Students may also wish to consult the list of resources and opportunities in gender and sexuality studies available online.\u000aREQUIREMENTS12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequired courses:\u000aRequirements for the Thesis Track: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aRequirements for Joint Concentration (thesis track only)\u000aWomen, Gender, and Sexuality as the Primary Concentration: 8 courses (32 credits) (including thesis)\u000aWomen, Gender, and Sexuality as the Allied Concentration: 5 courses (20 credits)\u000aRequired courses:\u000aADVISING\u000a	Whether they are full or joint concentrators, all students receive individual attention and advising from a core group of dedicated and highly-engaged faculty. The director of undergraduate studies is the primary academic adviser for sophomores and juniors, and the assistant director of undergraduate studies is the primary academic adviser for seniors. In consultation with their faculty advisers, students develop individual, cohesive plans of study tailored to their specific intellectual interests. Faculty members are closely involved with students\u2019 academic development at every stage of the concentration. Many of the courses offered by WGS are seminars, allowing for an exciting and productive exchange of ideas between students and faculty.\u000a	For up-to-date information on advising in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, please see the Advising Programs Office website.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America is the leading research library in the field. The library holds more than 35,000 volumes, 800 collections of personal and organizational papers, 50,000 photographs, oral histories, videotapes, and other historical materials. The library collects information on women's rights, suffrage, social welfare and reform, pioneers in the professions, and the family. Carol J. Pforzheimer Student Fellowships are awarded annually to undergraduates to use the resources of the library.\u000a	The Henry A. Murray Research Archive is a multidisciplinary research center whose focus is the study of lives over time. It is also a national archive for social science data on human development and social change, especially data that illuminate women's lives and issues of concern to women. Students and researchers at all levels, from undergraduates to scholars, use the center's resources. These include studies of family life, careers, psychological development, political participation, and mental health.\u000a	The Open Gate Foundation, "A Fund for Gay and Lesbian Life at Harvard University," is a private charitable foundation established by members of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus, which gives grants to student groups and faculty to help finance a variety of events and activities, including speakers, symposia, and film festivals. Further information may be obtained from the Open Gate website.\u000aSTUDY ABROAD\u000a	With good planning, a term abroad or out of residence can be a very meaningful educational experience. In the past our concentrators have spent terms in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Chile, Australia, Spain, and France. Most concentrators who study abroad do so in the fall term of junior year, which allows them to return to campus in time to take the junior tutorial (WGS 98) the following spring. Thesis track concentrators who wish to study abroad during the spring term of junior year must make special arrangements to complete the junior tutorial. If you are a concentrator considering a term abroad, please consult your concentration adviser as well as the Office of International Education as soon as possible. Plans for study out of residence must be approved by the University significantly in advance of the term in which a student plans to be away.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000a	For further information, contact the main office at 617-495-9199 or via email at wgs@fas.harvard.edu.

aV\u000aProfessor Anne Harrington, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The History and Science concentration at Harvard is a flourishing interdisciplinary field of study. We are also a small and friendly concentration, with a real sense of community, and we pride ourselves on finding ways to nurture students\u2019 individual interests through a flexible curriculum, and opportunities for one-on-one instruction, internships, behind the scenes museum and exhibition design opportunities, research assistantships with faculty, and special travel programs for concentrators only.\u000aWhy should I consider History and Science?\u000a	History and Science may be a good choice for you if:\u000a	(1) You would like to do significant work in some area of science (any field taught in the College) and combine it with historical, ethical and social analysis of how science, medicine, or technology works in the world.\u000a	 (2) You are interested in the ways in which science, medicine or technology is affected by (and in turn affects) important issues in politics, industry and policy, whether climate change, the teaching of evolution in the public schools, the patenting of genes and new forms of life, and more.\u000a	(3) You are interested in big questions  -- the existence of God, the nature of free will, the roots of human morality, and more \u2013 and would like to understand the ways in which science has shaped or is shaping the ways in which we think about them.\u000a	(4) You are considering attending medical school, and would like a concentration that allows you to count many of your premed science requirements, even as you take classes and do advanced research in the history of medicine, medical anthropology, and health policy.\u000a	(5) You are interested in computer science, or considering a career in engineering or information technology, and would like a concentration that allows you to count many computer science and engineering classes for concentration credit, even as you to take classes and do advanced research in the history and social analysis of technology, computer science, and the world of big data.\u000a	(5) You are \u2013 or aspire to be \u2013 a person who is equally literate in the world of the sciences and the world of the humanities and the social sciences.\u000a	(6) You would value a concentration that cares deeply about teaching, provides abundant opportunities for interaction with faculty, and will rigorously train you in essential analytic, presentation, and research skills that will be valuable for you, no matter what career you choose to pursue.\u000aHow is the concentration structured?\u000a	The concentration has a two-track structure that provides students with high levels of flexibility. Both of the tracks offer an honors and a non-honors option.\u000aThe Science and Society Track is designed for students who have an interest in doing significant course work in an area of science but who also want to study how science develops and affects the world: how it relates to industry, policy, politics and the broader culture. Students can both do science and analyze how science functions in the world of human affairs.\u000aThe History of Science Track does not require students to take science courses beyond the level mandated by General Education (though some may choose to do so and receive concentration credit). It offers students the possibility of studying the history and social relations of science more broadly. By taking a combination of courses from our department and also outside of it, students can learn how sciences as diverse as theoretical physics and economics interact with other areas of culture such as literature, film, art, or government.\u000a	Concentrators in History and Science generally combine course-work in the history of science, medicine or technology (broadly defined) with course-work focused in any area of science taught in the College. Our students also often take courses for concentration credit in global health, science and religion, medical ethics, sociology of science, philosophy of science, anthropology of medicine, and more. Tutorials are aimed at introducing concentrators to some of the most exciting questions in the field and training them with the reading, research, and writing skills they need to do original research of their own. By the time of graduation, all our concentrators possess advanced social science research skills, and often produce original academic work of very high quality.\u000a	The concentration also offers three special foci or paths through the program: (1) Medicine and Society,(2) Mind, Brain, and Behavior, and  (3) Technology, Information, and Society.\u000aMedicine and Society offers pre-medical students an opportunity to combine the science work required of them for medical school with disciplined historical and social science analysis of medicine, health care, public health and the allied medical sciences and medical technologies. This is an honors-only plan of study, and all students must write a senior thesis\u000a	 Mind, Brain, Behavior offers students with interdisciplinary leanings an opportunity to join a College-wide community of undergraduates from six different departments who have interests in the neurosciences and their allied fields, all while focusing their own studies in a mix of psychology, brain science, and the history of the mind, brain and human sciences. This is an honors-only plan of study, and all students must write a senior thesis\u000aTechnology, Information and Society offers students an opportunity to combine coursework in computer science and its allied fields (including select courses in engineering sciences) with courses in the history and social study of technology, computing, and information science. This is an honors-optional plan of study. Students are encouraged to write a senior thesis, but some may choose instead to take more advanced work in engineering or computer science during the course of their senior year.\u000aWhat are the requirements?\u000a	Every concentrator will take History of Science 100, (or an approved substitute), which is offered in the fall semester. In addition, every concentrator will take one semester of sophomore tutorial and one semester of junior tutorial, taught by faculty members and teaching fellows from the Department of the History of Science.\u000a	History of Science 97, the sophomore tutorial, is a hands-on course that introduces students to some of the most exciting and productive questions in the history of science, technology, and medicine, while developing critical reading, presentation, and discussion skills. Students work in groups to explore different aspects of a larger theme each week and share discoveries in sessions led by the faculty instructor. The course is further enhanced by a series of supervised individual group projects.\u000a	History of Science 98, the junior tutorial, is a course designed to train students in historical research, from how to work in archives to how to master relevant theoretical perspectives needed to think well about a research question. All students enrolled in this course are guided through an intense but supportive mentoring process that results in a 25-page independent research paper.\u000a	History of Science 99ab, the senior thesis tutorial, is an opportunity to spend a sustained period of time working on a research problem. Students choosing to write a senior thesis may be supervised by a faculty member or an advanced graduate student, and are free to pursue a diverse range of topics. Many of our theses go on to win College awards, and some have even been published. Students are welcome to look through the collection of past and present senior theses which are located in the Department of the History of Science.\u000aWhat can graduates do with a degree in History and Science?\u000a	Our graduates frequently go on to successful careers in many areas, especially in jobs or forms of further professional training that require or value both technical and social scientific understanding of information science, biotechnology, medicine, health and global health, the law, and public policy. Many win prestigious fellowships that allow them to pursue further academic study. Our alumni have had this to say about their experience with us:\u000a	\u201cIt was the most flexible, versatile, and practical concentration on campus. It prepared me for both research endeavors within the halls of academia as well as the critical thinking skills needed for graduate degree work.\u201d\u000a	 \u201cHistory and Science is the best concentration of all time. Period\u2026Liberal arts educations aren\u2019t intended to \u2018qualify\u2019 you for any particular job, but History and science provides you with a truly broad based, well rounded education and teaches you novel ways of looking at the world which have been invaluable to ne as a lawyer and as a human being.\u201d\u000a	Employers are increasingly looking for graduates who are not just literate but also scientifically literate, not just technically skilled in a special subject but able to see the larger cultural, social, and policy implications and impact of scientific and technical developments.  If this kind of breadth of vision appeals, our concentration may be right for you.\u000aREQUIREMENTSHistory of Science TrackBasic Requirements: 11 courses (44 credits)\u000aHistory of Science TrackRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aHistory of Science TrackNon-Thesis Option: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aScience and Society TrackBasic Requirements: 11 courses (44 credits)\u000aScience and Society TrackRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 13 courses (52 credits)\u000aScience and Society TrackNon-Thesis Option: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aMedicine and SocietyRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000a	The Medicine and Society focus in the Science and Society track is appropriate for students considering a career in medicine, health sciences, health policy, or who otherwise have a pronounced interest in the medical sciences.

aV\u000aProfessor Yukio Lippit, Director of Undergraduate Studies\u000a	The History of Art and Architecture concentration offers training in the historical interpretation and critical analysis of the visual arts and architecture. It develops the skills of visual discrimination and verbal expression fundamental to art historical analysis.\u000a	Encompassing material from the widest range of geographic and historical origins, art history is itself a multifaceted discipline embracing many different methods, perspectives and interests. Sometimes it deduces from works of art the time and place of their making, or the identity of their makers. Sometimes it examines how concepts, ideals, and sensibilities of people of the past are expressed in their art, and further, how that art influenced wider aspects of their culture.  Sometimes it explores within large-scale fabrications (buildings, towns, cities) the dynamic between human and natural worlds. These and other approaches are reflected in the teaching and scholarship of the History of Art and Architecture faculty.\u000a	Training in the critical analysis of art seeks to clarify the perception\u2014and understanding\u2014of how artworks relate to the techniques and materials used in their making, and to the environment in which they are seen. It also fosters the ability to make and explain judgments of quality and value. Instruction in critical analysis is aided by the history of art and architecture department\u2019s partnership with one of the world\u2019s greatest teaching museums, comprising the Fogg, Busch-Reisinger, and Sackler Museums. This offers students a unique opportunity of first-hand study of original works of art in many media.\u000a	Concentration requirements insure that students are well versed in both the historical and critical facets of the field. Generally, course work offers coverage of the history of art, while a sequence of small-group tutorials develop critical skills.  For students with a special interest in architecture, the concentration offers courses on architectural history and urban planning, while also helping to advise in, and coordinate, relevant coursework undertaken beyond the department.  Courses in the History of Art and Architecture undergraduate curriculum are structured as a three-tier system, consisting of a sequence of entry-level and field-specific introductory courses, upper-level courses, and tutorials.\u000a	History of Art and Architecture (HAA) 1, HAA 10, and HAA 11 are general, conceptual introductions (to world art from pre-history to the present, history of later western art, and history of world architecture, respectively) each of which could serve as a point of entry into the courses and concentration of History of Art and Architecture, as would the new Gen Ed offering HUM 11a, \u201cThe Art of Looking\u201d.\u000a	Tutorials are small-group seminars which discuss the methodology of the discipline or examine a specific research topic in the discipline. These are intended to provide increasing expertise in critical and analytical thinking, and serve as a basis for independent senior research projects. The senior thesis offers a student the opportunity to apply in greater depth one or more of the methods and aims developed in courses and tutorials, although, of course, theses often deal with subjects not included in class work.\u000a	The concentration in History of Art and Architecture can be pursued in conjunction with several other concentrations, most commonly Visual and Environmental Studies, English, Anthropology, Literature, area studies, or Romance Languages. Together with the Departments of the Classics, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, and Anthropology, the Department of History of Art and Architecture initiates students in the study of archaeology.\u000a	Architecture Studies is a track within the History of Art and Architecture concentration, jointly administered by the History of Art and Architecture and the Graduate School of Design. The track has its own requirements, which are detailed below. Students wishing to pursue other specific interests may receive advising from appropriate faculty as arranged by the director of undergraduate studies.\u000a	Requirements for all concentrators, joint and full, provide exposure to a variety of areas within art history, as well as allow for the selection of a major field focus from among the following: African, Ancient (Egypt, Ancient Near East, Greece, Rome), Architecture, Baroque and Rococo, Byzantine, Chinese, Japanese, South Asian, Islamic, Latin American/Pre-Columbian, Medieval, Modern and Contemporary, and Renaissance.\u000a	A History of Art and Architecture concentration is an effective core to a liberal arts education, and not merely pre-professional training for future art historians. The history of art and architecture is virtually unique among academic disciplines in studying the products of societies in every part of the world over the entire span of history, from the Paleolithic cave paintings to the works of our closest contemporaries.\u000a	Students concerned with joint concentration, credit for work done elsewhere, and late transfer into History of Art and Architecture should consult with the director of undergraduate studies. All concentrators should arrange advising appointments with the director of undergraduate studies at the start of each term.\u000aREQUIREMENTSBasic Requirements: 12 courses (48 credits)\u000aRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14 courses (56 credits)\u000aArchitecture Studies TrackRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14 courses (56 credits) and thesis\u000a	Architecture Studies is a track within the History of Art and Architecture concentration, jointly administered by the History of Art and Architecture and the Graduate School of Design, it pursues the study of architecture within the spirit of a liberal arts education.\u000a	The track has its own requirements, which are detailed below. A statement of purpose and a proposed course plan is required for Architecture Studies. Interested students should contact the HAA coordinator of undergraduate studies for further information on this process and on the curriculum overall.\u000a	Architecture stands at the intersection of creative imagination, practical realization, and social use, comprising not only material structures of human occupation, but also the dynamic processes that shape human action and experience. The study of architecture integrates technical and humanistic methods of inquiry with written and visual modes of representation, in traditional classroom venues and \u201cmaking\u201d-based studios designed especially for this concentration.\u000a	Within the Architecture Studies track, two broad areas of emphasis may be chosen:(1) History and Theory, which includes the study of architecture, cities, landscapes, designed objects, ornament, architectural photography, and material culture, in diverse places and time periods including Africa, the Americas, China, Europe, India, the Islamic world, and Japan, all from antiquity to the present; and (2) Design Studies, which includes investigations into the social and aesthetic dimensions of contemporary architecture, landscapes, cities, and territories, emphasizing issues of sustainable environments, new forms of urbanism, and the use of digital media for visualization and analysis.\u000a	Both the \u201cHistory and Theory\u201d and the \u201cDesign Studies\u201d areas teach architecture within the larger visual culture.\u000aHistory and Theory. Four courses in architecture or a related field, from offered courses numbered HAA 100-299 or related courses at the GSD, with approval by the Director of Undergraduate Studies (e.g., GSD 4121, 4122, 4223, 4141, 4142). Courses should be balanced between the two departments. Courses in the HAA 200 range require permission of instructor. Other courses from the HAA or GSD rosters, or courses from other departments, may be substituted with approval of the DUS (see item 6a).\u000a			 Or\u000aArchitecture Studies TrackRequirements for Honors Eligibility: 14 courses (56 credits) and thesis\u000aADVISING\u000a	Departmental academic advising is provided by the faculty, and by the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Yukio Lippit, who meets individually with concentrators to discuss course selection, tutorials, and thesis topics (usually at the beginning of each term and by appointment at other times).\u000aStudents are reminded, however, that they are each ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of concentration requirements, and should check regularly on the current status of their progress. Procedural information and advice is available throughout the year in the Undergraduate Office. Please contact the Coordinator of Undergraduate Studies, Thomas Batchelder at 2 Arrow Street, 3rd Floor, (617-495-2310), who is available on a walk-in basis during most regular office hours.

Our Department Chairman is Professor David Roxburgh.\u000aRESOURCES\u000a	History of Art and Architecture concentrators benefit from the unusually rich University collections of Harvard\u2019s five museums: the Fogg, Sackler, Busch-Reisinger (-the Harvard Art Museums), Semitic, and Peabody museums containing Western, Asian, and ethnographic art.  Concentrators often have an opportunity to be involved in aspects of museum operations, working with curators and museum staff to research pieces in the collection and/or share in the mounting of exhibitions. Harvard\u2019s library holdings in art and archaeology include more than 250,000 books and more than 1,500,000 photographs and slides.\u000a	The Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the Institute of Contemporary Arts are three of Boston\u2019s great cultural resources.  Entrance to these institutions is free to undergraduates who show their Harvard ID cards at the door.\u000aHOW TO FIND OUT MORE\u000aFor further information regarding the concentration contact the Coordinator of Undergraduate Studies, Thomas Batchelder, 2 Arrow Street, 3rd Floor, 617-495-2310; email: tbatchel@fas.harvard.edu.\u000aOffice hours: Monday through Friday, 9\u20135.\u000aENROLLMENT STATISTICSNumber of Concentrators as of December
